#Not so long ago... In the mysterious land... of Toronto, Canada... Scott Pilgrim was dating a high schooler
KIM: Scott Pilgrim is dating a high schooler?
---m2.jpg
STEPHEN: Really? Is she hot?
KIM: How old are you now, Scott? Like 28?
SCOTT: I'm not playing your little games, kids
KIM: So, you've been out of high school for, like, 13 years
SCOTT: I'm 22.
STEPHEN: And you're dating a high-school girl. Not bad, not bad.
SCOTT: Thank you, thank you. We almost held hands once, but then she got embarrassed.
KIM: Well, aren't you pleased as punch.
SCOTT: I don't know what you're talking about.
STEPHEN: So what's her name?
SCOTT: Knives Chau. She's Chinese.
NEIL: Wicked.
STEPHEN: So, when do we get to meet her?
KIM: Oh please, let it be soon.
---m3.jpg
#Doorbell rings
SCOTT: That's for me.
---m4.jpg
KNIVES: Hi.
SCOTT: You promised to be good?
KNIVES: Of course I'll be good.
SCOTT: Seriously, please be good.
KNIVES: Am I normally not?
---m6.jpg
SCOTT: Hey, Knives, this is Stephen Stills. He's the talent.
STEPHEN: Hey.
---m5.jpg
#Stephen shuts the door in Knives' face
STEPHEN: Is she gonna geek out on us?
SCOTT: She'll just sit in the corner, man.
STEPHEN: I mean, I want her to geek out on us.
SCOTT: She'll geek. She geeks. She has the capacity to geek.
STEPHEN: Okay.
---m7.jpg
#Knives was stunned to see a band. Scott warmly takes Knives' coat but coolly drops it on the floor. Kim does not like Knives a bit.
KNIVES: Wow.
SCOTT: Here, let me get your coat. Knives, that's Kim.
KNIVES: Sorry, what was your name?
KIM: Kim.
KNIVES: And you play the drums?
KIM: Yes.
KNIVES: That is so awesome.
---m8.jpg
#Knives thought Neil was a member of the band.
SCOTT: Knives, that's Neil.
NEIL: Hi.
KNIVES: Hi. What do you play?
NEIL: Wow, Zelda, Tetris. That's kind of a big question.
---m9.jpg
SCOTT: Okay, let's start with Launchpad McQuack.
STEPHEN: That's not the actual title of the...
KIM: We are Sex Bob-Omb. One! Two! Three!  Four...
---m10.jpg
#Rock music playing
KIM: You guys are so amazing.
===
---m11.jpg
STEPHEN: She seems nice.
SCOTT: Yeah.
NEIL: Yeah, she seems awesome.
SCOTT: Yeah.
---m12.jpg
KIM: Scott, if your life had a face, I would punch it.
SCOTT: Yeah. Wait, what?
KIM: I mean, are you really happy or are you really evil?
SCOTT: Like, do I have ulterior motives or something? I'm offended, Kim.
KIM: Wounded, even?
SCOTT: Hurt, Kim.
KIM: You? Hurt?
---m13.jpg
SCOTT: Neil, you were saying about "she seems awesome."
Neil: Yeah, she seems awesome.
SCOTT: Yeah.

---m14.jpg
#Afterwards in Scott's apartment with his roomate
SCOTT: Before you hear some dirty lies from someone else, yes, I'm dating a 17-year-old. So, the whole 17-year-old thing, don't tell too many people.
---m15.jpg
#Wallace text scott's sister
WALLACE: Hey, you know me.
SCOTT: I mean, don't tell my sister.
WALLACE: You know me.
SCOTT: Who are you texting?
---m16.jpg
#Phone rings. Scott's sister calls.
STACEY: Seventeen years old? Scandal!
SCOTT: That's not true. Who told you?
STACEY: Wallace. Duh.
SCOTT: That gossipy bitch.
WALLACE: You know me.
STACEY: Who is this mystery child you date?
SCOTT: Her name's Knives Chau. She's Chinese.
STACEY: A 17-year-old Chinese schoolgirl? You're ridiculous. 
---m17.jpg
STACEY:Scott, why are you doing this?
SCOTT: I don't know. It's just nice, you know? It's just simple.
STACEY: It's been over a year since you got dumped by She-Who-Will-Not-Be-Named. So... Are you legitimately moving on or is this just you being insane?
SCOTT: Can I get back to you on that?
===
---m18.jpg
#School bell rings
WALLACE: I do not wanna be here at all.
SCOTT: This school has boys, too.
Wallace: I hate you. Even I would think twice about dating a 17-year-old.
SCOTT: Well, she's only allowed out when the sun is up, so I wouldn't call it dating.
---m19.jpg
KNIVES: Scott!
SCOTT: Hey, Knives! This is my cool, gay roommate, Wallace Wells.
KNIVES: Hi.
SCOTT: He's gay.
KNIVES: Oh, do you wanna know who in my class is gay?
WALLACE: Yes, does he wear glasses?
---m20.jpg
SCOTT: Wallace, you go now. Begone.
WALLACE: You're too good for him. Run.
===
---m21.jpg
SCOTT: Did you know that the original name for Pac-Man was Puck-Man? You'd think it was because he looks like a hockey puck, but it actually comes from the Japanese phrase "paku-paku," which means, "to flap one's mouth open and closed." They changed it because they thought that "Puck-Man" would be too easy to vandalize. You know, people could just scratch off the "P" and turn it into an "F" or whatever.
---m22.jpg
KNIVES: Oh, my God! Like, wow!
SCOTT: Yeah. Wow.
---m23.jpg
#Game is over. Scott hints to Knives that she needs to buy more coins to continue the game.
KNIVES: Oh, I got it.
===
---m24.jpg
#At Goodwill store
KNIVES: I don't listen to that much music. I mean, I know a lot of kids who play piano or whatever, but you guys... You guys rock.
SCOTT: Well, I knew I personally rocked, but I never suspected that we rocked as a unit. So thank you, Knives.
---m25.jpg
KNIVES: I mean, you guys are gonna be huge.
SCOTT: Well, we're already pretty big, but, yeah, I guess it'd be cool, if cool people started wearing our T-shirt or whatever.
KNIVES: Cool.
SCOTT: Yeah yeah.
---m26.jpg
KNIVES: Excuse me, do you have anything by The Clash at Demonhead?
JULIE: Have you tried the section marked "The Clash at Demonhead"?
SCOTT: Thank you, Julie.
JULIE: Are you coming to my party Friday, or will you be busy babysitting?
---m27.jpg
SCOTT: Thank you, Julie. You don't want to listen to her.
---m28.jpg
SCOTT: And you definitely don't want to listen to them.
KNIVES: Oh, I heart them so much.
SCOTT: Yeah, I hearted them, too, until they signed to a major label, and the lead singer turned into a total bitch and ruined my life forever. But that's just me.
KNIVES: Envy Adams is so cool. Do you read her blog?
SCOTT: Sorry, you were saying about me?
===
---m29.jpg
KNIVES: I mean, I've never gone out with anyone so talented.
SCOTT: Go out with a lot of guys?
KNIVES: No.
SCOTT: Yeah, so, whatever, man.
KNIVES: I've never even kissed a guy.
SCOTT: Hey, me, neither.
---m30.jpg

---m31.jpg
SCOTT: Here you go. 
KNIVES: So this is your secret lair? 
SCOTT: Yeah, yeah.
KNIVES: Can I come in?
SCOTT: My secret lair is one of those "No girls allowed"-type deals.
KNIVES: Okay.
SCOTT: But do you wanna see the house where I grew up?
KNIVES: Sure!
SCOTT: Come on.
---m32.jpg
#Scott turns around and points the other side of the street.
SCOTT: There you go.
KNIVES: Wow.
SCOTT: Yeah.
===
---m33.jpg
#In Scott's dream
SCOTT: So alone.
RAMONA: You are not alone.
SCOTT: What?
RAMONA: You are just having some idiotic dream.
SCOTT: Does that mean we can make out?
---m34.jpg
SCOTT: Oh, God! I had this totally weird dream. There was this girl.
WALLACE: Weren't you supposed to take your fake high-school girlfriend to the library a half-hour ago?
---m35.jpg
#In library
SCOTT: It's weird.
KNIVES: What's weird?
SCOTT: Libraries remind me of grade school.
KNIVES: That must seem like a really long time ago.
SCOTT: Yeah, let's talk about something else.
---m36.jpg
---m37.jpg
---m38.jpg
KNIVES: Do you know that girl?
===
---m39.jpg
SCOTT: Sorry, what are we doing?
STEPHEN: I told you, like, 50 times!
KIM: We're going to this party, retard.
SCOTT: Party?
NEIL: At Julie's.
SCOTT: Ah. I thought you guys split up.
STEPHEN: We did, but there might be some label guys there, so, you know...
SCOTT: Oh, man, this is gonna suck.
KIM: At least it'll give us something to complain about.
SCOTT: Oh, man.
---m40.jpg
#At Julie's party
SCOTT: This sucks!
NEIL: Sucks!
---m41.jpg
COMEAU: Scott! Hey!
SCOTT: Hey, Comeau.
COMEAU: How about this party? You getting your drink on here?
SCOTT: No, I don't drink. This is just Coke Zero.
COMEAU: What do you mean, you don't drink? I distinctly remember you being very drunk off a couple of G-and-T's...
SCOTT: Hey, Comeau, you know everyone, right?
COMEAU: Yeah, pretty much, I do.
---m42.jpg
SCOTT: You know this one girl with hair like this?
COMEAU: Yes, that's Ramona Flowers. Somebody said she was gonna be here tonight, actually.
SCOTT: What?
---m43.jpg
#Scott searches for Ramona
---m44.jpg
---m45.jpg
---m46.jpg
---m47.jpg
#Scott gets closer to Ramona
---m48.jpg
SCOTT: Hey, what's up?
RAMONA: Nothing.
SCOTT: Hey, you know Pac-Man?
RAMONA: I know of him.
SCOTT: Well, Pac-Man was originallly called Puck-Man. They changed it because... Not because Pac-Man looks like a hockey puck. "Paku-paku" means "flap your mouth," and that they were afraid people would change... Scratch out the "P" and turn it into an "F," like... (Chuckles nervously)
RAMONA: Yeah, that's amazing.
---m49.jpg
SCOTT: Um... Am I dreaming?
RAMONA:
SCOTT: I'll leave you alone forever now.
RAMONA: Thanks.
---m50.jpg
---m51.jpg
---m52.jpg
---m53.jpg
---m54.jpg
SCOTT: Dude!
NEIL: What?
SCOTT: She's totally real!
NEIL: Who?
SCOTT: Ramona Flowers.
NEIL: What?
---m55.jpg
SCOTT: Dude! What do you know about Ramona Flowers?
COMEAU: All I know is that she is American.
SCOTT: American.
COMEAU: Why don't you go talk to Sandra and Monique? They know a lot about her.
---m56.jpg
SCOTT: Lady-dudes. What do you know about Ramona Flowers?
SANDRA: I heard she has a boyfriend.
MONIQUE: Yeah. Some guy back in New York.
SCOTT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. What else?
---m57.jpg
I heard she kicks all kinds of ass.
---m58.jpg
She's on another level.
---m59.jpg
She has men dying at her feet.
---m60.jpg
She's got some battle scars, dude.
---m61.jpg
JULIE: What about Ramona Flowers?
SCOTT: You know her? Tell me now.
JULIE: She just moved here. Got a job at Amazon. Comes into my work.
SCOTT: Does she really?
---m62.jpg
STEPHEN: Didn't you say she just broke up with someone?
SCOTT: Did she really?
STEPHEN: They had a huge fight, or whatever.
SCOTT: Did they really?
JULIE: Yes! But I didn't want Scott to know that, Stephen.
SCOTT: Yeah, I don't know what it is about that girl.
JULIE: Scott, I forbid you from hitting on Ramona, even if you haven't had a real girlfriend in over a year.
STEPHEN: Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Scott's mourning period is officially over. He's totally dating a high-schooler.
JULIE: Dating a high-schooler is the mourning period.
---m63.jpg
STEPHEN: She's got a point.
SCOTT: I thought you guys broke up.
JULIE: I don't want you scaring off the coolest girl at my party, Scott. We all know you're a total lady-killer wannabe, jerky-jerk.
SCOTT: That's completely untrue.
JULIE: That time with Lisa?
SCOTT: That was a misunderstanding.
JULIE: That time with Hollie?
SCOTT: That wasn't what it looked like.
---m64.jpg
JULIE: That time you dumped Kim for...
SCOTT: Okay Me and Kim are all good now, all right?
JULIE: Whatever! Ramona's out of your league. Let's just leave it at that. Besides, I'm not even sure she did have a big breakup. She keeps mentioning some guy named Gideon.
---m65.jpg
SCOTT: Yeah, I don't know what it is about that girl.
JULIE: Foget it, Scott!
===
---m66.jpg
#Later at his apartment, Scott receives a call from his sister.
STACEY: You're thinking of juggling two chicks?
SCOTT: Not even!
STACEY: Well, you should break up with your fake high-school girlfriend.
SCOTT: Wait, who told you?
STACEY: Wallace. Duh! You of all people should know how sucky it is to get cheated on.
SCOTT: Don't you have a job to do?
STACEY: You're right. I should send out a mass text about this. Bye.
---m67.jpg
#Knives comes to Scott's apartment.
KNIVES: Attack hug!
SCOTT: Hey! Attack hug. That's so cute. So cute.
KNIVES: You don't remember? You're supposed to meet me at the bus stop a half-hour ago.
SCOTT: How could I possibly forget?
---m68.jpg
KNIVES: Yearbook club is so boring. I cannot believe the music they put on while we work.
SCOTT: That's sucky.
---m69.jpg
KNIVES: Hannah broke up with Alan and now she's all into Derek. But then Tamara claims she has dibs on Derek.
SCOTT: I tell you.
---m70.jpg
#Arcade is counting down after game is over.
KNIVES: Do you want to keep going?
SCOTT: I think... I think that we should...
===
---m71.jpg
---m72.jpg
STEPHEN: Game on, everybody. Game on. I got us a show.
---m73.jpg
KNIVES: Oh, my gosh, when?
STEPHEN: Wednesday. The Rockit. And even better, it's the T.I.B.B.
NEIL: Whoa.
KNIVES: The Toronto International Battle of the Bands?
STEPHEN: That's right. This guy at work was like, "Steve, you know anybody in a band?" And I was like, "I'm in a band." And he was like, "You're in a band?" And I was like, "Yeah, I am totally in a band."
---m74.jpg
KIM: Great story, man.
---m75.jpg
KNIVES: Is there a prize or something?
STEPHEN: Only a record deal with G-Man Graves.
SCOTT: Who's that?
KNIVES: You don't know?
STEPHEN: Indie producer of the millennium.
SCOTT: Oh.
---m76.jpg
STEPHEN: If we win, it won't just be Knives wearing Sex Bob-Omb shirts. It'll be the cool kids, too.
===
---m77.jpg
#Back in Scott's apartment, he orders from Amazon expecting Ramona would deliver the package to his door.
SCOTT: Wallace! Amazon.ca, what's the website for that?
WALLACE: Amazon.ca
SCOTT: I have to order something really cool.
COMPUTER: You've got mail.
SCOTT: Dude, this thing claims I have mail.
WALLACE: It's amazing what we can do with computers these days.
SCOTT: Dude, now I'm reading it.
WALLACE: So happy for you.
---m78.jpg
SCOTT: "Dear Mr. Pilgrim, it has come to my attention that we will be fighting soon. My name is Matthew Patel, and..." Blah, blah, blah... "Fair warning... Mano y mano... Seven evil..." Blah, blah.
---m79.jpg
SCOTT: This is...
---m80.jpg
SCOTT: This is... This is...
---m81.jpg
SCOTT: This is...

WALLACE: What?
SCOTT: This is boring. Delete.
---m83.jpg  
WALLACE: Scott, are you waiting for the package you just ordered?
SCOTT: Maybe.
WALLACE: It's the weekend. It won't ship until Monday at the earliest.
---m84.jpg
#Doorbell rings
SCOTT: You were saying?
---m85.jpg
RAMONA: Uh, Scott Pilgrim?
SCOTT: Hi, I was thinking about asking you out, but then I realized how stupid that would be. So, do you want to go out sometime?
---m86.jpg
RAMONA: No, that's okay. You can just sign for this, all right?
SCOTT: You don't remember me, do you? We met at the party the other day.
RAMONA: Were you the Pac-Man guy?
---m87.jpg
SCOTT: No. Not even. That was some total ass. I was the other guy.
RAMONA: You know, you need to sign for this, whatever this is.
SCOTT: But if I sign for it, you'll leave.
RAMONA: Yeah, it's how it works.
SCOTT: Okay, well, maybe, do you wanna hang out sometime? Get to know each other? You're the new kid on the block, right? I've lived here forever, so there are reasons for you to hang out with me.
---m88.jpg
RAMONA: You want me to hang out with you?
SCOTT: Yeah, if that's cool.
RAMONA: If I say yes, will you sign for your damn package?
---m89.jpg
#Scott signs the package and throws it into garbage bin.
SCOTT: So, yeah, 8:00?
===
---m90.jpg
SCOTT: Why are you just standing there?
RAMONA: Dude, I'm totally waiting on you.
SCOTT: I'm sorry, I just assumed you were too cool to be here on time.
RAMONA: Oh, you assumed wrong.
---m91.jpg
SCOTT: So, how did you end up in Toronto?
RAMONA: Just needed to escape, I guess.
SCOTT: Yeah.
RAMONA: I got this job here, and Gideon had always said Toronto was one of the great cities, so...
SCOTT: Is Gideon your boyfriend?
RAMONA: He's a friend.
SCOTT: Was he your boyfriend?
RAMONA: Do you mind if I don't get into that right now?
SCOTT: It's so not interesting to me.
---m92.jpg
RAMONA: So, what about you? What do you do?
SCOTT: I'm in between jobs at the moment.
RAMONA: Between what and what?
SCOTT: Well, my last job was a long story filled with sighs.
RAMONA: I know plenty of those.
SCOTT: Is that why you left New York?
RAMONA: Pretty much. It was just time to head somewhere a little more chilled.
SCOTT: Well, it's certainly chilled here.
RAMONA: Yeah.
SCOTT: It's chilled, as in cold.
RAMONA: Yeah.
---m92a.jpg
RAMONA: This is ridiculous. Isn't it, like, April?
SCOTT: I know. I can barely see you. This whole thing is an unmitigated disaster. 
RAMONA: I think act of God is a pretty decent excuse for a lousy date.
SCOTT: So this is a date, eh?
RAMONA: Did I say date? Slip of the tongue.
SCOTT: Tongue.
---m93.jpg
RAMONA: Anyway, night's not over yet. I think there's a thingy over here, somewhere.
SCOTT: A thingy?
RAMONA: A door. Come on.
---m94.jpg

---m96.jpg
RAMONA: What kind of tea do you want?
SCOTT: There's more than one kind?
RAMONA: We have blueberry, raspberry, ginseng, Sleepytime, green tea, green tea with lemon, green tea with lemon and honey, liver disaster, ginger with honey, ginger without honey, vanilla-almond, white truffle, blueberry-chamomile, vanilla-walnut, Constant Comment and Earl Grey.
SCOTT: Did you make some of those up?
RAMONA: I think I'll have Sleepytime.
SCOTT: That sounds good to me.

SCOTT: Hey, so, can this not be a one-night stand? For one thing, I didn't even get any. That was a joke.
RAMONA: What did you have in mind?
SCOTT: Come to the first round of this Battle of the Bands thing.
RAMONA: You have a band?
SCOTT: Yeah, we're terrible. Please, come?

KIM: Once we're on stage, you'll be fine.
STEPHEN: We were just on stage for sound check, and the sound guy hated us.
SCOTT: It's just nerves. Pre-show jitters.
===
---m123.jpg
STACEY: So how do you know Scott?
RAMONA: He's a friend.
STACEY: It's hard for me to keep track sometimes, because he has so many friends. Knives, how did you meet Scott?
