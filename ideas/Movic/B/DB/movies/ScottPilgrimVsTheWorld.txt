KIM: Scott Pilgrim is dating a high schooler?

STEPHEN: Really? Is she hot?
KIM: How old are you now, Scott? Like 28?
SCOTT: I'm not playing your little games, kids
KIM: So, you've been out of high school for, like, 13 years
SCOTT: I'm 22.
STEPHEN: And you're dating a high-school girl. Not bad, not bad.
SCOTT: Thank you, thank you. We almost held hands once, but then she got embarrassed.
KIM: Well, aren't you pleased as punch.

STEPHEN: So what's her name?
SCOTT: Knives Chau. She's Chinese.

#Knives was stunned to see a band. Scott warmly takes Kives' coat but coolly drops it on the floor. Kim does not like Knives a bit.
KNIVES: Wow.
SCOTT: Here, let me get your coat. Knives, that's Kim.
KNIVES: Sorry, what was your name?
KIM: Kim.
KNIVES: And you play the drums?
KIM: Yes.
KNIVES: That is so awesome.

#Knives thought Young was a member of the band.
SCOTT: Knives, that's Young Neil.
YOUNG: Hi.
KNIVES: Hi. What do you play?
YOUNG: Wow, Zelda, Tetris. That's kind of a big question.
---m9.jpg
SCOTT: Okay, let's start with Launchpad McQuack.

#Rock music playing
KIM: You guys are so amazing.

STEPHEN: She seems nice.
SCOTT: Yeah.
YOUNG: Yeah, she seems awesome.
SCOTT: Yeah.
---m12.jpg
KIM: Scott, if your life had a face, I would punch it.
SCOTT: Yeah. Wait, what?
KIM: I mean, are you really happy or are you really evil?
SCOTT: Like, do I have ulterior motives or something? I'm offended, Kim.
KIM: Wounded, even?
SCOTT: Hurt, Kim.
KIM: You? Hurt?
---m13.jpg
SCOTT: Neil, you were saying about "she seems awesome."
Neil: Yeah, she seems awesome.
SCOTT: Yeah.

#Afterwards in Scott's apartment with his roomate
SCOTT: Before you hear some dirty lies from someone else, yes, I'm dating a 17-year-old. So, the whole 17-year-old thing, don't tell too many people.
---m15.jpg
#Wallace text scott's sister
WALLACE: Hey, you know me.
SCOTT: I mean, don't tell my sister.
WALLACE: You know me.
SCOTT: Who are you texting?
---m16.jpg
#Phone rings. Scott's sister calls.
STACEY: Seventeen years old? Scandal!
SCOTT: That's not true. Who told you?
STACEY: Wallace. Duh.
SCOTT: That gossipy bitch.
WALLACE: You know me.
STACEY: Who is this mystery child you date?
SCOTT: Her name's Kives Chau. She's Chinese.
STACEY: A 17-year-old Chinese schoolgirl? You're ridiculous. 
---m17.jpg
STACEY:Scott, why are you doing this?
SCOTT: I don't know. It's just nice, you know? It's just simple.
STACEY: It's been over a year since you got dumped by She-Who-Will-Not-Be-Named. So... Are you legitimately moving on or is this just you being insane?
SCOTT: Can I get back to you on that?

#School bell rings
WALLACE: I do not wanna be here at all.
SCOTT: This school has boys, too.
Wallace: I hate you. Even I would think twice about dating a 17-year-old.
SCOTT: Well, she's only allowed out when the sun is up, so I wouldn't call it dating.
---m19.jpg
KNIVES: Scott!
SCOTT: Hey, Kives! This is my cool, gay roommate, Wallace Wells.
KNIVES: Hi.
SCOTT: He's gay.
KNIVES: Oh, do you wanna know who in my class is gay?
WALLACE: Yes, does he wear glasses?
---m20.jpg
SCOTT: Wallace, you go now. Begone.
WALLACE: You're too good for him. Run.

SCOTT: Did you know that the original name for Pac-Man was Puck-Man? You'd think it was because he looks like a hockey puck, but it actually comes from the Japanese phrase "paku-paku," which means, "to flap one's mouth open and closed." They changed it because they thought that "Puck-Man" would be too easy to vandalize. You know, people could just scratch off the "P" and turn it into an "F" or whatever.
---m22.jpg
KNIVES: Oh, my God! Like, wow!
SCOTT: Yeah. Wow.
---m23.jpg
#Game is over. Scott hints to Knives that she needs to buy more coins to continue the game.
KNIVES: Oh, I got it.

#At Goodwill store
KNIVES: I don't listen to that much music. I mean, I know a lot of kids who play piano or whatever, but you guys... You guys rock.
SCOTT: Well, I knew I personally rocked, but I never suspected that we rocked as a unit. So thank you, Knives.
---m25.jpg
KNIVES: I mean, you guys are gonna be huge.
SCOTT: Well, we're already pretty big, but, yeah, I guess it'd be cool, if cool people started wearing our T-shirt or whatever.
KNIVES: Cool.
SCOTT: Yeah yeah.
---m26.jpg
KNIVES: Excuse me, do you have anything by The Clash at Demonhead?
JULIE: Have you tried the section marked "The Clash at Demonhead"?
SCOTT: Thank you, Julie.
JULIE: Are you coming to my party Friday, or will you be busy babysitting?
---m27.jpg
SCOTT: Thank you, Julie. You don't want to listen to her.
---m28.jpg
SCOTT: And you definitely don't want to listen to them.
KNIVES: Oh, I heart them so much.
SCOTT: Yeah, I hearted them, too, until they signed to a major label, and the lead singer turned into a total bitch and ruined my life forever. But that's just me.
KNIVES: Envy Adams is so cool. Do you read her blog?
SCOTT: Sorry, you were saying about me?
===
---m29.jpg
KNIVES: I mean, I've never gone out with anyone so talented.
SCOTT: Go out with a lot of guys?
KNIVES: No.
SCOTT: Yeah, so, whatever, man.
KNIVES: I've never even kissed a guy.
SCOTT: Hey, me, neither.
---m30.jpg

---m31.jpg
SCOTT: Here you go. 
KNIVES: So this is your secret lair? 
SCOTT: Yeah, yeah.
KNIVES: Can I come in?
SCOTT: My secret lair is one of those "No girls allowed"-type deals.
KNIVES: Okay.
SCOTT: But do you wanna see the house where I grew up?
KNIVES: Sure!
SCOTT: Come on.
---m32.jpg
#Scott turns around and points the other side of the street.
SCOTT: There you go.
KNIVES: Wow.
SCOTT: Yeah.
