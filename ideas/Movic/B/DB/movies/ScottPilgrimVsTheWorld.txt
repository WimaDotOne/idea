#Not so long ago... In the mysterious land... of Toronto, Canada... Scott Pilgrim was dating a high schooler
KIM: Scott Pilgrim is dating a high schooler?
---m2.jpg
STEPHEN: Really? Is she hot?
KIM: How old are you now, Scott? Like 28?
SCOTT: I'm not playing your little games, kids
KIM: So, you've been out of high school for, like, 13 years
SCOTT: I'm 22.
STEPHEN: And you're dating a high-school girl. Not bad, not bad.
SCOTT: Thank you, thank you. We almost held hands once, but then she got embarrassed.
KIM: Well, aren't you pleased as punch.
SCOTT: I don't know what you're talking about.
STEPHEN: So what's her name?
SCOTT: Knives Chau. She's Chinese.
NEIL: Wicked.
STEPHEN: So, when do we get to meet her?
KIM: Oh please, let it be soon.
---m3.jpg
#Doorbell rings
SCOTT: That's for me.
---m4.jpg
KNIVES: Hi.
SCOTT: You promised to be good?
KNIVES: Of course I'll be good.
SCOTT: Seriously, please be good.
KNIVES: Am I normally not?
---m6.jpg
SCOTT: Hey, Knives, this is Stephen Stills. He's the talent.
STEPHEN: Hey.
---m5.jpg
#Stephen shuts the door in Knives' face
STEPHEN: Is she gonna geek out on us?
SCOTT: She'll just sit in the corner, man.
STEPHEN: I mean, I want her to geek out on us.
SCOTT: She'll geek. She geeks. She has the capacity to geek.
STEPHEN: Okay.
---m7.jpg
#Knives was stunned to see a band. Scott warmly takes Knives' coat but coolly drops it on the floor. Kim does not like Knives a bit.
KNIVES: Wow.
SCOTT: Here, let me get your coat. Knives, that's Kim.
KNIVES: Sorry, what was your name?
KIM: Kim.
KNIVES: And you play the drums?
KIM: Yes.
KNIVES: That is so awesome.
---m8.jpg
#Knives thought Neil was a member of the band.
SCOTT: Knives, that's Neil.
NEIL: Hi.
KNIVES: Hi. What do you play?
NEIL: Wow, Zelda, Tetris. That's kind of a big question.
---m9.jpg
SCOTT: Okay, let's start with Launchpad McQuack.
STEPHEN: That's not the actual title of the...
KIM: We are Sex Bob-Omb. One! Two! Three!  Four...
---m10.jpg
#Rock music playing
KIM: You guys are so amazing.
===
---m11.jpg
STEPHEN: She seems nice.
SCOTT: Yeah.
NEIL: Yeah, she seems awesome.
SCOTT: Yeah.
---m12.jpg
KIM: Scott, if your life had a face, I would punch it.
SCOTT: Yeah. Wait, what?
KIM: I mean, are you really happy or are you really evil?
SCOTT: Like, do I have ulterior motives or something? I'm offended, Kim.
KIM: Wounded, even?
SCOTT: Hurt, Kim.
KIM: You? Hurt?
---m13.jpg
SCOTT: Neil, you were saying about "she seems awesome."
Neil: Yeah, she seems awesome.
SCOTT: Yeah.

---m14.jpg
#Afterwards in Scott's apartment with his roomate
SCOTT: Before you hear some dirty lies from someone else, yes, I'm dating a 17-year-old. So, the whole 17-year-old thing, don't tell too many people.
---m15.jpg
#Wallace text scott's sister
WALLACE: Hey, you know me.
SCOTT: I mean, don't tell my sister.
WALLACE: You know me.
SCOTT: Who are you texting?
---m16.jpg
#Phone rings. Scott's sister calls.
STACEY: Seventeen years old? Scandal!
SCOTT: That's not true. Who told you?
STACEY: Wallace. Duh.
SCOTT: That gossipy bitch.
WALLACE: You know me.
STACEY: Who is this mystery child you date?
SCOTT: Her name's Knives Chau. She's Chinese.
STACEY: A 17-year-old Chinese schoolgirl? You're ridiculous. 
---m17.jpg
STACEY:Scott, why are you doing this?
SCOTT: I don't know. It's just nice, you know? It's just simple.
STACEY: It's been over a year since you got dumped by She-Who-Will-Not-Be-Named. So... Are you legitimately moving on or is this just you being insane?
SCOTT: Can I get back to you on that?
===
---m18.jpg
#School bell rings
WALLACE: I do not wanna be here at all.
SCOTT: This school has boys, too.
Wallace: I hate you. Even I would think twice about dating a 17-year-old.
SCOTT: Well, she's only allowed out when the sun is up, so I wouldn't call it dating.
---m19.jpg
KNIVES: Scott!
SCOTT: Hey, Knives! This is my cool, gay roommate, Wallace Wells.
KNIVES: Hi.
SCOTT: He's gay.
KNIVES: Oh, do you wanna know who in my class is gay?
WALLACE: Yes, does he wear glasses?
---m20.jpg
SCOTT: Wallace, you go now. Begone.
WALLACE: You're too good for him. Run.
===
---m21.jpg
SCOTT: Did you know that the original name for Pac-Man was Puck-Man? You'd think it was because he looks like a hockey puck, but it actually comes from the Japanese phrase "paku-paku," which means, "to flap one's mouth open and closed." They changed it because they thought that "Puck-Man" would be too easy to vandalize. You know, people could just scratch off the "P" and turn it into an "F" or whatever.
---m22.jpg
KNIVES: Oh, my God! Like, wow!
SCOTT: Yeah. Wow.
---m23.jpg
#Game is over. Scott hints to Knives that she needs to buy more coins to continue the game.
KNIVES: Oh, I got it.
===
---m24.jpg
#At Goodwill store
KNIVES: I don't listen to that much music. I mean, I know a lot of kids who play piano or whatever, but you guys... You guys rock.
SCOTT: Well, I knew I personally rocked, but I never suspected that we rocked as a unit. So thank you, Knives.
---m25.jpg
KNIVES: I mean, you guys are gonna be huge.
SCOTT: Well, we're already pretty big, but, yeah, I guess it'd be cool, if cool people started wearing our T-shirt or whatever.
KNIVES: Cool.
SCOTT: Yeah yeah.
---m26.jpg
KNIVES: Excuse me, do you have anything by The Clash at Demonhead?
JULIE: Have you tried the section marked "The Clash at Demonhead"?
SCOTT: Thank you, Julie.
JULIE: Are you coming to my party Friday, or will you be busy babysitting?
---m27.jpg
SCOTT: Thank you, Julie. You don't want to listen to her.
---m28.jpg
SCOTT: And you definitely don't want to listen to them.
KNIVES: Oh, I heart them so much.
SCOTT: Yeah, I hearted them, too, until they signed to a major label, and the lead singer turned into a total bitch and ruined my life forever. But that's just me.
KNIVES: Envy Adams is so cool. Do you read her blog?
SCOTT: Sorry, you were saying about me?
===
---m29.jpg
KNIVES: I mean, I've never gone out with anyone so talented.
SCOTT: Go out with a lot of guys?
KNIVES: No.
SCOTT: Yeah, so, whatever, man.
KNIVES: I've never even kissed a guy.
SCOTT: Hey, me, neither.
---m30.jpg

---m31.jpg
SCOTT: Here you go. 
KNIVES: So this is your secret lair? 
SCOTT: Yeah, yeah.
KNIVES: Can I come in?
SCOTT: My secret lair is one of those "No girls allowed"-type deals.
KNIVES: Okay.
SCOTT: But do you wanna see the house where I grew up?
KNIVES: Sure!
SCOTT: Come on.
---m32.jpg
#Scott turns around and points the other side of the street.
SCOTT: There you go.
KNIVES: Wow.
SCOTT: Yeah.
===
---m33.jpg
#In Scott's dream
SCOTT: So alone.
RAMONA: You are not alone.
SCOTT: What?
RAMONA: You are just having some idiotic dream.
SCOTT: Does that mean we can make out?
---m34.jpg
SCOTT: Oh, God! I had this totally weird dream. There was this girl.
WALLACE: Weren't you supposed to take your fake high-school girlfriend to the library a half-hour ago?
---m35.jpg
#In library
SCOTT: It's weird.
KNIVES: What's weird?
SCOTT: Libraries remind me of grade school.
KNIVES: That must seem like a really long time ago.
SCOTT: Yeah, let's talk about something else.
---m36.jpg
---m37.jpg
---m38.jpg
KNIVES: Do you know that girl?
===
---m39.jpg
SCOTT: Sorry, what are we doing?
STEPHEN: I told you, like, 50 times!
KIM: We're going to this party, retard.
SCOTT: Party?
NEIL: At Julie's.
SCOTT: Ah. I thought you guys split up.
STEPHEN: We did, but there might be some label guys there, so, you know...
SCOTT: Oh, man, this is gonna suck.
KIM: At least it'll give us something to complain about.
SCOTT: Oh, man.
---m40.jpg
#At Julie's party
SCOTT: This sucks!
NEIL: Sucks!
---m41.jpg
COMEAU: Scott! Hey!
SCOTT: Hey, Comeau.
COMEAU: How about this party? You getting your drink on here?
SCOTT: No, I don't drink. This is just Coke Zero.
COMEAU: What do you mean, you don't drink? I distinctly remember you being very drunk off a couple of G-and-T's...
SCOTT: Hey, Comeau, you know everyone, right?
COMEAU: Yeah, pretty much, I do.
---m42.jpg
SCOTT: You know this one girl with hair like this?
COMEAU: Yes, that's Ramona Flowers. Somebody said she was gonna be here tonight, actually.
SCOTT: What?
---m43.jpg
#Scott searches for Ramona
---m44.jpg
---m45.jpg
---m46.jpg
---m47.jpg
#Scott gets closer to Ramona
---m48.jpg
SCOTT: Hey, what's up?
RAMONA: Nothing.
SCOTT: Hey, you know Pac-Man?
RAMONA: I know of him.
SCOTT: Well, Pac-Man was originallly called Puck-Man. They changed it because... Not because Pac-Man looks like a hockey puck. "Paku-paku" means "flap your mouth," and that they were afraid people would change... Scratch out the "P" and turn it into an "F," like... (Chuckles nervously)
RAMONA: Yeah, that's amazing.
---m49.jpg
SCOTT: Um... Am I dreaming?
RAMONA:
SCOTT: I'll leave you alone forever now.
RAMONA: Thanks.
---m50.jpg
---m51.jpg
---m52.jpg
---m53.jpg
---m54.jpg
SCOTT: Dude!
NEIL: What?
SCOTT: She's totally real!
NEIL: Who?
SCOTT: Ramona Flowers.
NEIL: What?
---m55.jpg
SCOTT: Dude! What do you know about Ramona Flowers?
COMEAU: All I know is that she is American.
SCOTT: American.
COMEAU: Why don't you go talk to Sandra and Monique? They know a lot about her.
---m56.jpg
SCOTT: Lady-dudes. What do you know about Ramona Flowers?
SANDRA: I heard she has a boyfriend.
MONIQUE: Yeah. Some guy back in New York.
SCOTT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. What else?
---m57.jpg
I heard she kicks all kinds of ass.
---m58.jpg
She's on another level.
---m59.jpg
She has men dying at her feet.
---m60.jpg
She's got some battle scars, dude.
---m61.jpg
JULIE: What about Ramona Flowers?
SCOTT: You know her? Tell me now.
JULIE: She just moved here. Got a job at Amazon. Comes into my work.
SCOTT: Does she really?
---m62.jpg
STEPHEN: Didn't you say she just broke up with someone?
SCOTT: Did she really?
STEPHEN: They had a huge fight, or whatever.
SCOTT: Did they really?
JULIE: Yes! But I didn't want Scott to know that, Stephen.
SCOTT: Yeah, I don't know what it is about that girl.
JULIE: Scott, I forbid you from hitting on Ramona, even if you haven't had a real girlfriend in over a year.
STEPHEN: Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Scott's mourning period is officially over. He's totally dating a high-schooler.
JULIE: Dating a high-schooler is the mourning period.
---m63.jpg
STEPHEN: She's got a point.
SCOTT: I thought you guys broke up.
JULIE: I don't want you scaring off the coolest girl at my party, Scott. We all know you're a total lady-killer wannabe, jerky-jerk.
SCOTT: That's completely untrue.
JULIE: That time with Lisa?
SCOTT: That was a misunderstanding.
JULIE: That time with Hollie?
SCOTT: That wasn't what it looked like.
---m64.jpg
JULIE: That time you dumped Kim for...
SCOTT: Okay Me and Kim are all good now, all right?
JULIE: Whatever! Ramona's out of your league. Let's just leave it at that. Besides, I'm not even sure she did have a big breakup. She keeps mentioning some guy named Gideon.
---m65.jpg
SCOTT: Yeah, I don't know what it is about that girl.
JULIE: Foget it, Scott!
===
---m66.jpg
#Later at his apartment, Scott receives a call from his sister.
STACEY: You're thinking of juggling two chicks?
SCOTT: Not even!
STACEY: Well, you should break up with your fake high-school girlfriend.
SCOTT: Wait, who told you?
STACEY: Wallace. Duh! You of all people should know how sucky it is to get cheated on.
SCOTT: Don't you have a job to do?
STACEY: You're right. I should send out a mass text about this. Bye.
---m67.jpg
#Knives comes to Scott's apartment.
KNIVES: Attack hug!
SCOTT: Hey! Attack hug. That's so cute. So cute.
KNIVES: You don't remember? You're supposed to meet me at the bus stop a half-hour ago.
SCOTT: How could I possibly forget?
---m68.jpg
KNIVES: Yearbook club is so boring. I cannot believe the music they put on while we work.
SCOTT: That's sucky.
---m69.jpg
KNIVES: Hannah broke up with Alan and now she's all into Derek. But then Tamara claims she has dibs on Derek.
SCOTT: I tell you.
---m70.jpg
#Arcade is counting down after game is over.
KNIVES: Do you want to keep going?
SCOTT: I think... I think that we should...
===
---m71.jpg
---m72.jpg
STEPHEN: Game on, everybody. Game on. I got us a show.
---m73.jpg
KNIVES: Oh, my gosh, when?
STEPHEN: Wednesday. The Rockit. And even better, it's the T.I.B.B.
NEIL: Whoa.
KNIVES: The Toronto International Battle of the Bands?
STEPHEN: That's right. This guy at work was like, "Steve, you know anybody in a band?" And I was like, "I'm in a band." And he was like, "You're in a band?" And I was like, "Yeah, I am totally in a band."
---m74.jpg
KIM: Great story, man.
---m75.jpg
KNIVES: Is there a prize or something?
STEPHEN: Only a record deal with G-Man Graves.
SCOTT: Who's that?
KNIVES: You don't know?
STEPHEN: Indie producer of the millennium.
SCOTT: Oh.
---m76.jpg
STEPHEN: If we win, it won't just be Knives wearing Sex Bob-Omb shirts. It'll be the cool kids, too.
===
---m77.jpg
#Back in Scott's apartment, he orders from Amazon expecting Ramona would deliver the package to his door.
SCOTT: Wallace! Amazon.ca, what's the website for that?
WALLACE: Amazon.ca
SCOTT: I have to order something really cool.
COMPUTER: You've got mail.
SCOTT: Dude, this thing claims I have mail.
WALLACE: It's amazing what we can do with computers these days.
SCOTT: Dude, now I'm reading it.
WALLACE: So happy for you.
---m78.jpg
SCOTT: "Dear Mr. Pilgrim, it has come to my attention that we will be fighting soon. My name is Matthew Patel, and..." Blah, blah, blah... "Fair warning... Mano y mano... Seven evil..." Blah, blah.

SCOTT: This is...

SCOTT: This is... This is...

SCOTT: This is...

WALLACE: What?
SCOTT: This is boring. Delete.

WALLACE: Scott, are you waiting for the package you just ordered?
SCOTT: Maybe.
WALLACE: It's the weekend. It won't ship until Monday at the earliest.
---m84.jpg
#Doorbell rings
SCOTT: You were saying?
---m85.jpg
RAMONA: Uh, Scott Pilgrim?
SCOTT: Hi, I was thinking about asking you out, but then I realized how stupid that would be. So, do you want to go out sometime?
---m86.jpg
RAMONA: No, that's okay. You can just sign for this, all right?
SCOTT: You don't remember me, do you? We met at the party the other day.
RAMONA: Were you the Pac-Man guy?
---m87.jpg
SCOTT: No. Not even. That was some total ass. I was the other guy.
RAMONA: You know, you need to sign for this, whatever this is.
SCOTT: But if I sign for it, you'll leave.
RAMONA: Yeah, it's how it works.
SCOTT: Okay, well, maybe, do you wanna hang out sometime? Get to know each other? You're the new kid on the block, right? I've lived here forever, so there are reasons for you to hang out with me.
---m88.jpg
RAMONA: You want me to hang out with you?
SCOTT: Yeah, if that's cool.
RAMONA: If I say yes, will you sign for your damn package?
---m89.jpg
#Scott signs the package and throws it into garbage bin.
SCOTT: So, yeah, 8:00?
===
---m90.jpg
SCOTT: Why are you just standing there?
RAMONA: Dude, I'm totally waiting on you.
SCOTT: I'm sorry, I just assumed you were too cool to be here on time.
RAMONA: Oh, you assumed wrong.
---m91.jpg
SCOTT: So, how did you end up in Toronto?
RAMONA: Just needed to escape, I guess.
SCOTT: Yeah.
RAMONA: I got this job here, and Gideon had always said Toronto was one of the great cities, so...
SCOTT: Is Gideon your boyfriend?
RAMONA: He's a friend.
SCOTT: Was he your boyfriend?
RAMONA: Do you mind if I don't get into that right now?
SCOTT: It's so not interesting to me.
---m92.jpg
RAMONA: So, what about you? What do you do?
SCOTT: I'm in between jobs at the moment.
RAMONA: Between what and what?
SCOTT: Well, my last job was a long story filled with sighs.
RAMONA: I know plenty of those.
SCOTT: Is that why you left New York?
RAMONA: Pretty much. It was just time to head somewhere a little more chilled.
SCOTT: Well, it's certainly chilled here.
RAMONA: Yeah.
SCOTT: It's chilled, as in cold.
RAMONA: Yeah.
---m92a.jpg
RAMONA: This is ridiculous. Isn't it, like, April?
SCOTT: I know. I can barely see you. This whole thing is an unmitigated disaster. 
RAMONA: I think act of God is a pretty decent excuse for a lousy date.
SCOTT: So this is a date, eh?
RAMONA: Did I say date? Slip of the tongue.
SCOTT: Tongue.
---m93.jpg
RAMONA: Anyway, night's not over yet. I think there's a thingy over here, somewhere.
SCOTT: A thingy?
RAMONA: A door. Come on.
---m94.jpg

---m96.jpg
RAMONA: What kind of tea do you want?
SCOTT: There's more than one kind?
RAMONA: We have blueberry, raspberry, ginseng, Sleepytime, green tea, green tea with lemon, green tea with lemon and honey, liver disaster, ginger with honey, ginger without honey, vanilla-almond, white truffle, blueberry-chamomile, vanilla-walnut, Constant Comment and Earl Grey.
SCOTT: Did you make some of those up?

SCOTT: Come to the first round of this Battle of the Bands thing.
RAMONA: You have a band?

STEPHEN: God! This is a nightmare. Is this a nightmare? Wake up, wake up, wake up!
---m122.jpg
KIM: Once we're on stage, you'll be fine.
STEPHEN: We were just on stage for sound check, and the sound guy hated us.
SCOTT: It's just nerves. Pre-show jitters.
---m123.jpg
STACEY: So how do you know Scott?
RAMONA: He's a friend.
STACEY: It's hard for me to keep track sometimes, because he has so many friends. Knives, how did you meet Scott?

Yeah, is he a pirate?

MATTHEW: Pirates are in this year.
---m165.jpg
SCOTT: You really went out with this guy?
---m166.jpg
RAMONA: Yeah. In the 7th grade.
SCOTT: And?
RAMONA: It was football season, all the little jocks wanted me.
---m167.jpg
RAMONA: Matthew was the only non-white, non-jock boy in town. So the two of us joined forces and we took'em all down. We brawled and scrapped and fought for hours. Nothing could beat Matthew's mystical powers. We only kissed once. After a week and a half, I told him to hit the showers.
SCOTT: Dude, wait. Mystical powers?
---m168.jpg

RAMONA: I'll lend you the 35 cents.
ANNOUNCER: Yeah, so, Sex Bob-Omb wins.
===
---m179.jpg
SCOTT: So, what was all that all about?
---m180.jpg
RAMONA: I guess, if we're gonna date, you may have to defeat my seven evil exes.
---m181.jpg
SCOTT: You have seven evil ex-boyfriends?
RAMONA: Seven evil exes, yes.
SCOTT: And I have to fight...
RAMONA: Defeat.
SCOTT: Defeat your seven evil exes if we're going to continue to date?
RAMONA: Pretty much.
---m182.jpg
SCOTT: So, what you're saying right now is we are dating?
RAMONA: I guess.
SCOTT: Does that mean we can make out?
RAMONA: Sure.
SCOTT: Cool.

#At Scott's apartment
---m183.jpg
---m183a.jpg
SCOTT: So, I invited Ramona over for dinner tonight, so you can't be here. I don't want you gaying up the place.
WALLACE: Okay, Scott. But in return, I have to issue an ultimatum.
SCOTT: One of your famous ultimatums?
---m184.jpg
WALLACE: It may live in infamy. You have to break up with  Knives, that poor angel, today.
---m185.jpg
SCOTT: But it's hard.
WALLACE: If you don't, I'm going to tell Ramona about Knives. I swear to God, Scott. Give me the bacon, and go do your dirt while I watch the Lucas Lee marathon.
SCOTT: Who's Lucas Lee?
---m186.jpg
WALLACE: Oh! He was this pretty good skater. Now he's this pretty good actor. He's filming a Winifred Hailey movie in Toronto right now.
SCOTT: They make movies in Toronto?
WALLACE: I'm stalking him later.
SCOTT: So, this Lucas Lee...
WALLACE: Lucas Lee is not important to you right now. Get out.

SCOTT: Hey, Knives. Hey, do you wanna, like, talk or whatever?
KNIVES: Are you wearing a tan jacket, like, a spring jacket, and a hoodie? And a dorky hat?
SCOTT: It's not dorky. Why are you psychic?
---m190.jpg
KNIVES: Hey!
SCOTT: Hey. Hey.
---m191.jpg
KNIVES: I can't believe TCAD's coming to town. Will you take me to the show?
SCOTT: Yeah, listen...
---m192.jpg
KNIVES: Hey, I wanted to invite you over for dinner.
SCOTT: Like, Chinese food?
KNIVES: To meet my parents. It's my birthday dinner.
SCOTT: I think that's a really bad idea.
KNIVES: No, it's okay. Why?
SCOTT: I'm too old for you. 
KNIVES: No, you're not. My dad is nine years older than my mom.
SCOTT: Are you even allowed to date outside your race or whatever?
---m193.jpg
KNIVES: I don't care. I'm... I'm in... love.
---m194.jpg
#Scott waves away the "LOVE" smoke.
---m195.jpg
SCOTT: Uh... Listen, I was thinking we should break up or whatever. 
---m196.jpg
KNIVES: Really?
---m197.jpg
SCOTT: Yeah. It's not gonna work out.
---m198.jpg
KNIVES: Oh.

KIM: Where's Knives. Not coming tonight?
SCOTT: No, we broke up. Hey, check it out, I learned the bass line from Final Fantasy II.
---m203.jpg
KIM: Scott, you are the salt of the earth.
SCOTT: Thanks.
KIM: I meant scum of the earth.
SCOTT: Thanks.
---m204.jpg
NEIL: You broke up with Knives?
SCOTT: Yeah, but don't worry. Maybe soon you'll meet my new-new girlfriend.
NEIL: New-new.
---m205.jpg
---m206.jpg
STEPHEN: Okay, from here on out, no girlfriends or girlfriend talk at practice. Whether they're old, new, or new-new. We were lucky to survive the last round. It's sudden death now, okay?
SCOTT: Okay.

#The band starts practicing

#Doorbell rings
SCOTT: That's for me. That's for me. That's for me.
---m209.jpg
SCOTT: Hey, you're here.
RAMONA: Yes, like you said.
SCOTT: You know your hair?
RAMONA: I know of it.
SCOTT: It's all blue.
RAMONA: I change my hair every week and a half, dude. Get used to it.
---m210.jpg
RAMONA: So... How do you guys all know each other?
NEIL: High school, I guess.
STEPHEN: What Neil said.
NEIL: I'm Neil.
---m211.jpg
KIM: Believe it or not, I actually dated Scott in high school.
RAMONA: Got any embarrassing stories?
KIM: Yeah, he's an idiot.
---m212.jpg
SCOTT: Okay, bye. See you guys tomorrow.
STEPHEN: What about rehearsal?
SCOTT: Neil knows my parts.

#At Scott's apartment
---m214.jpg
WALLACE: You doing okay, there?
SCOTT: Yeah, good, good, good. She changed her hair.
WALLACE: So? It looks nice blue.
SCOTT: Yeah, I know, but she did it without even making a big deal of it or anything. She's fickle. Impulsive. Spontaneous. God, what am I gonna do?
WALLACE: Can't believe you're worried about me gaying up the place.
---m215.jpg
RAMONA: So, how's dinner coming along?
SCOTT: Yeah, good, good, good.
WALLACE: Okay, well, I'm gonna leave you lovebirds to it. I am heading up to Casa Loma to stalk my hetero crush.
---m216.jpg
SCOTT: (Whispers) Don't go!
WALLACE: Will you man the hell up? You can get to second and a half base tonight.
SCOTT: You think so?
WALLACE: Well, if you strike ou in the next hour, come find me at the castle.
SCOTT: If I strike out?
WALLACE: Okay, when. See you in 60.

#15 minutes later
RAMONA: This is actually really good garlic bread.
SCOTT: Garlic bread is my favorite food. I could honestly eat it for every meal. Or just eat it all the time without even stopping. 
RAMONA: You'd get fat.
SCOTT: No, why would I get fat?
---m220.jpg
RAMONA: Bread makes you fat.
---m221.jpg
SCOTT: Bread makes you fat?
---m222.jpg
#30 minutes later
SCOTT: I wrote a song about you.
RAMONA: You did?
SCOTT: Yeah, it goes like this.
---m223.jpg
#Scott sings.
SCOTT: "Ramona. Ramona. On my mind. Ramona."
---m224.jpg
KNIVES: Can't wait to hear it when it's finished.
SCOTT: Finished?
---m225.jpg
#45 minutes later
RAMONA: Your hair's pretty shaggy.
---m226.jpg
SCOTT: Oh, God, I need a haircut, don't I?
RAMONA: What?
SCOTT: No, sorry. I just... I got a bad haircut right before me and my big ex broke up, but that was so long ago now I can barely remember.
---m227.jpg
#Scott is acutely aware that his last salon haircut took place exactly 431 days ago, three hours before his big breakup. He's been cutting his own hair ever since.
SCOTT: So long ago.
---m228.jpg
RAMONA: Sounds like a bad time.
SCOTT: Bad time? Not really.
NARRATOR: It was.
SCOTT: It was a mutual thing.
NARRATOR: It wasn't.
---m229.jpg
SCOTT: I mean, she told me it was mutual.
NARRATOR: She dumped him. It was brutal.
RAMONA: What was her name?
SCOTT: She was Nat, when I knew her, but she stopped liking that name. Then she stopped liking me.
---m230.jpg
RAMONA: Your hair is cute. I like it long.
SCOTT: But it would be cuter short, wouldn't it?
RAMONA: What?
---m231.jpg
#Scott puts on a hat
SCOTT: What?
RAMONA: Why are you wearing that hat?
SCOTT: I thought we could go for a walk.
===
---m232.jpg
#60 minutes later
RAMONA: Tell me we didn't come out here in the cold so you could cover your hair with hat.
SCOTT: No, no. I just love me some walking, you know. Just putting one leg in front of the other, like this. Walking.
---m233.jpg
RAMONA: You seem a little heightened.
SCOTT: Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. I just sort of feel like I'm on drugs when I'm with you. Not that I do drugs, unless you do drugs, in which case I do drugs all the time. Every drug. Yeah, I don't know. Just when I'm with you, things sort of seem a little brighter.
---m234.jpg
RAMONA: What is this place?
SCOTT: It's a totally awesome castle. They are shooting this movie here right now.
===
---m235.jpg
---m236.jpg
RAMONA: Did you find the guy you were stalking?
WALLACE: I think I'm about to right now.
DIRECTOR: Mr. Lee is traveling.
RAMONA: Mr. Lee?
WALLACE: Lucas Lee.
RAMONA: Oh.
SCOTT: Oh?
---m237.jpg
#Lucas walks out
---m238.jpg
WALLACE: I wanna have his adopted babies.
RAMONA: Oh, man, we got to go.
SCOTT: What? Why?
RAMONA: I used to date that clown.
SCOTT: Oh my god. You dated a famous guy?
RAMONA: In ninth grad. We had drama. Actually, it might have been math. I just remember there being a lot of drama.
---m239.jpg
RAMONA: He was a snot-nosed little bra. He just followed me around.
SCOTT: He had snot in his nose? But he's famous.
---m240.jpg 
LUCAS: Hey! I'm talking to you, Scott Pilgrim.
SCOTT: He's famous and he talked to me.
LUCAS: The only thing keeping me and her apart is the two minutes it's gonna take to kick your ass.
---m241.jpg
SCOTT: Can I have your...Can I have your autograph, please?
---m242.jpg
---m243.jpg
LUCAS: What's up? How's life? He seems nice.
