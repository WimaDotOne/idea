#Concord, Massachusetts. In a bedroom Jo curls Meg's hair.
MEG: I know exactly who I wanna dance with.
AMY: Who will you dance with, Jo?
JO: I never dance.
---m2.jpg
AMY: Why can't we all go to the party? It's not fair.
JO: Just wear your regular shoes.
MEG: These fit last winter.
AMY: My nose simply will not look refined.
---m3.jpg
BETH: I like your nose.
---m4.jpg
AMY: Now, Jo.
JO: Don't touch me, thanks. I already feel ridiculous. I don't wanna look it.
AMY: You could be pretty if you tried.
JO: Don't want to. Won't do it.
BETH: I don't want to go, but I wish I could hear the music.
JO: I'll keep it in my head and sing it for you.
---m5.jpg
BETH: Ought they to smoke like that?
JO: It's the dampness drying.
AMY: What a queer smell, like burnt feathers.
JO: Now I'll take this off and you'll see a perfect ringlet.
---m6.jpg
#Jo burns off a lock of Meg's hair
BETH: Why is her hair off?
JO: Sorry.
---m7.jpg
MEG: What have you done?
JO: Sorry. You shouldn't have asked me to do it.
MEG: Marmee! I can't go, I'm spoiled. My hair!

#At the party
---m8.jpg
MEG: Don't stare, don't put your hands behind your back, don't say "Christopher Columbus" or "capital."
JO: All right.
MEG: Don't shake hands. Don't whistle.
---m9.jpg
#Meg's friend Sallie leads her away
SALLIE: Meg March, you look so pretty.
JO: Meg.
---m10.jpg
#Later Jo leans on a door way with her arms folded. She glumly watches well-dressed people dance. Meg does elegant steps with a beared man, smiles as they cirle each other.
---m11.jpg
#Jo cranes her neck as her sister finishes her dancing. Jo guestures to leave. Meg shakes her head and turns to her partner. Jo rolls her eyes and sighs. Across the room, a tall man waves at her. Jo sneaks away.
---m12.jpg
#Jo moves behind a curturn and backs into Laurie's chair.
JO: Ooh! Sorry. I didn't know anyone was here.
---m13.jpg
LAURIE: Not at all. Stay if you like.
JO: I won't distrub you?
---m14.jpg
LAURIE: No. I don't know many people here. I felt rather strange at first, you know?
JO: Mm-hm. So do I.
---m15.jpg
#They shake hands and smile warmly at each other.
LAURIE: Miss March, isn't it?
JO: Yes, Mr. Laurence, but I'm not Miss March. I'm only Jo.
LAURIE: And I'm not Mr. Laurence, I'm only Laurie.
---m16.jpg
#Jo glaces towards the other room.
JO: Don't you dance?
LAURIE: I don't know how you do things here yet. I've spent most of my life in Europe.
JO: Europe! Oh, that's capital! Shouldn't use words like that.
LAURIE: Says who?
JO: Oh, Meg. She's my older sister. Here.
---m17.jpg
#She parts the curturn and they peer through.
JO: Oh, that's her. See? The girl in the violet dress.
LAURIE: Oh, it's pretty.
---m18.jpg
#They sit
JO: She reminds me to be good, so Father will be proud when he returns.
LAURIE: Where is he?
JO: He volunteered for the Union Army. I wanted to go fight with him. I can't get over my disappointment in being a girl.
LAURIE: Jo, would you like to dance with me?
JO: I can't because... Mm.
LAURIE: Because of what?
JO: You won't tell?
LAURIE: Never.
---m19.jpg
JO: I scorched my dress. See? There. Meg told me to keep still, so no one would see it. You can laugh if you want to. It's funny, I know.
LAURIE: I have an idea of how we can manage.

#On the porch outside the ball room. Laurie offers his hand and Jo take it. 
---m21.jpg
#They stride quickly past the window and then stop. 
---m22.jpg
#She gives him a silly smile and they clumsily dance back. Jo bump into him.
---m23.jpg
#Now they walk by a window. Once out of view, they jump around wildly. They duck past another window and grip arms and step in cirles. They jump around again and continue on.
---m24.jpg
#Meg comes to the window.
JO: What?
MEG: My foot. I hurt my ankle.
---m25.jpg
MEG: How am I gonna get home?
JO: I don't see what you can do, except get a carriage or stay here all night.
MEG: Carriages are too expensive.
LAURIE: Let me take you. It's right next door.
MEG: Oh, no, thank you. We cannot accept.
LAURIE: You must take mine, please?
MEG: No. It's so early. You can't mean to leave yet.
LAURIE: I always leave early. I do, truly.
JO: What choice do you have, hm?

---m26.jpg
#Later, at home, Marmee opens the door with a grin
MOM: Good gracious. What have you done?
JOE: She's lame and can't walk. She's hobbling.
---m27.jpg
#Joe and Laurie help Meg inside. Beth and Amy come downstairs. They take meg to a chair.
JOE: Clear that chair. 
MOM: You're supposed to be asleep. All right, help your sister, then back to bed.
JOE: Make room. Meg is a wounded soldier.
MOM: Meg, you'll yourself for fashision one of these days.
---m28.jpg
#Laurie stands apart.
MOM: Hannah, we need ice! Oh, come in.
LAURIE: Is it all right?
MOM: Apologies for the chaos. I enjoy baking in the middle of the night. Don't mind the clutter, Mr. Laurence. We don't.
LAURIE: Laurie, please.
JOE: Can I call you Teddy?
LAURIE: Yes.
MOM: You must be part of their theatricals. You'll have to fight Jo for the male roles or play a girl. Have a scone.
LAURIE: Yes, thank you.
---m29.jpg
AMY: I'm Amy.
LAURIE: Hello.
---m30.jpg
MOM: Laurie, how are your ankles? Do you need ice?
LAURIE: No, thank you, ma'am.
MOM: Just call me "mother" or Marmee. Everyone does.
---m31.jpg
HANNAH: And you wore those pink shoes too, didn't you?
MEG: But they look so good, okay?
BETH: It's cold.
JO: Do you want more ice?
MEG: It feels like being a fine young lady to come home from a party in a carriage and have maids wait on me.
---m32.jpg
#Outside, Laurie crosses a snow covered yard. He peers back at March's home and spots Jo in the attic window.
---m33.jpg
===
---m34.jpg
#Christmas. Jo wakes. She yarns and stretches. Jo glances around the attic and then sits up on a small sofa. She looks out the window at the picturesque snow-covered field and trees.
JO: Merry Christmas, world.
---m35.jpg
#She gathers several pages and joins her sisters downstairs.
---m36.jpg
MEG: Jo, we've been up for hours.
BETH: What have you been writing?
JO: Oh, I got carried away with our delicious revenge play last night, Poison.
AMY: No, no poison. It's Christmas.
JO: Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents.
MEG: It's so dreadful being poor. 
AMY: It's not fair. How come some girls have pretty things and others have nothing at all?
BETH: We have Father, Mother and each other.
JO: We haven't got Father for as long as this war drags on.
---m37.jpg
MEG: I wish I had heaps of money and plenty of servants, so that I never had to work again.
JO: Or you could be a proper actress on the boards. They aren't all fallen women.
MEG: I can't be an actress.
---m38.jpg
JO: I have lots of wishes, but my favorite one is to be an artist in Paris and to do fine pictures and to be the best painter in the world.
BETH: That's what you want too, isn't it, Jo? Be a famous writer?
JO: Yes, but it sounds crass when she says it.
AMY: Why be ashamed of what you want?
---m39.jpg
BETH: My wish is to have us all to be together with Father and Mother in this house. That's what I want.
AMY: Beth is perfect.
JO: Amy.
MEG: What about your music, Queen Beth, huh?
BETH: I do that for us. I don't need anyone else to hear it.
AMY: You must not limit yourself.
MEG: Mother proposed not having any presents this year because our men are suffering in the Army. We can't do much, but we can make our little sacrifices and do it gladly.
---m40.jpg
#Jo throws a pillow at Meg's face.
JO: Don't play mother just because she's not home.
AMY: Jo, that's so boyish.
JO: That's why I do it.
AMY: I detest rude, unladylike girls.
JO: I hate affected little chits.
---m41.jpg
#Jo tackles Amy to the floor. Hannah carries in a bow and finds all four sisters wrestling.
HANNAH: I know you don't care what I think, but you don't want your mother to find you like this, do you?
---m42.jpg
MEG: Of course we care what you think, Hannah. 
JO: You're more family than wicked old Aunt March.
MEG: Oh, don't, Jo.
JO: Where is Marmee? I'm starving.
---m43.jpg
HANNAH: Goodness only knows. Some poor creature came a-begging. Your ma sets straight off to see what was needed.
JO: I wish she could help others at a time convenient to us.
BETH: Joanna and I are very hungry.
AMY: Dolls don't get hungry, Beth.
===
---m44.jpg
JO: I've rewritten the climax. We need to set it to memory. Amy, get the costumes.
AMY: I have made the most divine crown, and I painted my old shoes blue, so she looks like a princess!
---m45.jpg
JO: I think the melancholy piece I've figured out is pretty good.
---m46.jpg
JO: Meg, wait until you see the new speech.
BETH: I don't see how you can write such splended things, Jo. You're a regular Shakespeare.
JO: Not quite. 
JO: All right. Miss Michelangelo, can you please rehearse the fainting scene? You're as stiff as a poker.
---m47.jpg
AMY: I can't help it. I never saw anyone faint before. I don't intend to make myself all black and blue. If I can fall down easily, I'll drop. And if I cannot, I shall fall gracefully into a chair. And I don't care if Hugo comes at me with a pistol.
---m48.jpg
JO: Hannah?
HANNAH: I'm not acting.
JO: I didn't even say a thing.
HANNAH: I knew what you were going to say, and I'm not acting.
