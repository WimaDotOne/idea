#Concord, Massachusetts. In a bedroom Jo curls Meg's hair.
MEG: I know exactly who I wanna dance with.
AMY: Who will you dance with, Jo?
JO: I never dance.

AMY: Why can't we all go? It's not fair.
JO: Just wear your regular shoes.
MEG: These fit last winter.
AMY: My nose simply will not look refined.

BETH: I like your nose.

AMY: Now, Jo.
JO: Don't touch me, thanks. I already feel ridiculous. I don't wanna look it.
AMY: You could be pretty if you tried.
JO: Don't want to. Won't do it.
BETH: I don't want to go, but I wish I could hear the music.
JO: I'll keep it in my head and sing it for you.

BETH: Ought they to smoke like that?
JO: It's the dampness drying.
AMY: What a queer smell, like burnt feathers.
JO: Now I'll take this off and you'll see a perfect ringlet.

#Jo burns off a lock of Meg's hair
BETH: Why is her hair off?
JO: Sorry.

MEG: What have you done?
JO: Sorry. You shouldn't have asked me to do it.
MEG: Marmee! I can't go, I'm spoiled. My hair!
