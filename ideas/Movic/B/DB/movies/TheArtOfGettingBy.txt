GEORGE: Since the dawn of recorded history, something like 110 billion human beings have been born into this world. And not a single one of them made it. 
---m2.jpg
GEORGE: There are 6.8 billion people on the planet. Roughly 60 million of them die every year. 60 million people. That comes out to about 160,000 per day.
---m3.jpg
GEORGE: I read this quote once when I was a kid, "We live alone, we die alone. Everything else is just an illusion." It used to keep me up at night. We all die alone.
---m4.jpg
GEORGE: So, why am I supposed to spend my life working, sweating, struggling? For an illusion?
---m5.jpg
GEORGE: Because no amount of friends, no girl, no assignments about conjugating the pluperfect or determining the square root of the hypotenuse is gonna help me avoid my fate.
---m6.jpg
---m7.jpg
GEORGE: I have better things to do with my time.

#George doodles as the teacher collects assignments
---m9.jpg
TEACHER: Do you have your work, George?
GEORGE: No.
TEACHER: Why not?
GEORGE: I was depressed.
TEACHER: Oh, yes? Why was that?
---m10.jpg
GEORGE: Because I realized I'm gonna die one day.
TEACHER: We're all gonna die one day, George. I don't think that's a reasonable excuse for not completing your trigonometry exercise.
GEORGE: Well, I was trying to. I just couldn't shake this awareness of my mortality. Everything seemed meaningless, including the assignment, unfortunately.
TEACHER: I want you to go to the principal's office and find meaning in the homework. Bring it to me completed by the end of the period.

#George goes outside school to have a cigarette.
---m12.jpg
TEACHER: You're late.
GEORGE: I was so engrossed in my work.
TEACHER: Boy, I wouldn't wanna be you right now. 
GEORGE: I haven't done anything.
TEACHER: You've always done something.
---m13.jpg
#Principal guestures George to go to his office.
TEACHER: You better go.
---m14.jpg
GEORGE: Bill.
PRINCIPAL: Even though you have off-campus privileges as a senior, if you are seen anywhere in the city smoking, you have your privileges revoked. Automatic probation.
GEORGE: Why are you telling me?
PRINCIPAL: You think I can't smell?
GEORGE: You can smell all you want.
---m15.jpg
GEORGE: Shall we get down to business?
PRINCIPAL: George, if you keep performing the way you are, forget about college, forget about graduating, even. So, this counts as your official warning. Suspension is next.
GEORGE: I thought probation was next.
PRINCIPAL: Don't play the angles, George. They won't work. Neither do jokes.
GEORGE: I wasn't joking. 
---m16.jpg
PRINCIPAL: I know you are capable.
GEORGE: I have a real problem with motivating. But I think I can do it. I'll try.
PRINCIPAL: All right, go. And don't make me regret it.

#George went to the rooftop
---m18.jpg
#George sees SALLY smokes
---m19.jpg
#A teacher comes to the rooftop. Sally throws away her cigarette and slips away as George deliberately attracts the teacher's attension by showing his cigarette.
TEACHER: Who's smoking up here? George, what do you think you're doing?
GEORGE: I was having a tough day. I guess the stress finally got to me, Mrs Dougherty.
TEACHER: George, why do you do these things? Now, what do you mean by stress.

#Sally mouths "Thank you" to George.

#George comes home
---m22.jpg
MOM: Hi
GEORGE: Hi.
MOM: I got an email from your school.
GEORGE: Jesus.
MOM: Some kind of academic probation? Can I help you? Can I you a tutor or a private college advisor? If you don't get into a decent school, then I don't know how you gonna get a job.
GEORGE: I have it under control.
MOM: Honey, if you don't get into a decent college...
GEORGE: I am gonna watch TV...
MOM: No, you will not watch TV. You will stay here till we can come up with a plan for getting you into college.
---m23.jpg
GEORGE: I had a hard day at school. I'm tired. I'm gonna relax now for half an hour. Then I will do my work. Okay?
===
---m24.jpg
TEACHER: George, what are you doing?
GEORGE: I'm drawing.
TEACHER: Are you sketching your subject?
GEORGE: Yes.
---m25.jpg
---m26.jpg
GEORGE: I don't have subject, Harris.
TEACHER: Why the heck not?
GEORGE: I don't know.
TEACHER: George, you're going to have to start digging around in there, so you can develop that talent of yours, to express that beautiful heart of yours. So figure out what you want to say, and say it.
---m27.jpg
GEORGE: Harris.
TEACHER: Yes.
GEORGE: I don't have anything to say.
TEACHER: (Shouting) Find something!

SALLY: Hey.
GEORGE: Hey.
SALLY: I'm Sally.
GEORGE: I know. 
---m29.jpg
SALLY: Thanks for covering for me. Why did you?
GEORGE: I don't know. You were doing something so renegade, I think you deserve to get away with it. I run afoul of the authorities so often, I figured I could handle it better than you.
SALLY: You are really weird. 
---m30.jpg
SALLY: So why don't you ever do your work.
GEORGE: There are so many more important things to think about. Homework ends up seeming like an afterthought.
SALLY: ADD?
GEORGE: No, they tried everything. Ritalin, Lexapro, tutors, therapy. Nothing worked. I'm the Teflon slacker. It's more like we're living in a dying time, you know? I mean, you got global warming, wars, terrorism, tsnamis.
SALLY: Okay...
GEORGE: We're definitely on the downhill side. So, what are we working towards? What's the point?
SALLY: I thought I had fears, but they're pretty run-of-the-mill. Pain, death.
GEORGE: Oh, not me. I fear life.
---m31.jpg
SALLY: Do you have any friends, George?
GEORGE: I'm kind of a misanthrope. Not a choice, just a fact.
---m32.jpg
SALLY: You wanna come up?
===
---m33.jpg
GEORGE: How did you end up in New York?
SALLY: My mom had me when she was 16. My dad was a truck driver, and one day he took off and never came back.
GEORGE: And this was?
SALLY: Clarksburg. It's a small town in Tennessee. This rich guy from New York, who owned a textile plant, started coming down, and it was like we were castaways and he was the ship. But I ended up here, 8 years old, new school, new friends, fancy new clothes. My mom divorced him a year ago and now she's back on the singles scene with a vengeance.
---m34.jpg
SALLY: I do think I should get some homework done though.
GEORGE: I should get going then. Got work to do myself.
SALLY: Yeah, right.
GEORGE: Thank you.
SALLY: Goodbye.

#George goes home
GEORGE: What happens to the electricity?
---m37.jpg
MOM: Hi, sweetie. We got take-out from the rotisserie chicken place.
JACK: Grab a plate and join us.
GEORGE: But the lights, What happened?
MOM: It's my fault. I forgot to pay the bill. And it's no big deal. They'll be on tomorrow.
---m38.jpg
JACK: George, we're trying to turn this awkward little mix-ip into a fun experience. And if you can't get into the spirit of adventure, then you can just do your own thing. You don't have to stick around.
GEORGE: I'm sorry, Jack. I can't use my laptop, much less get my assignments.
JACK: So, go to the library or Starbucks. Be resourceful.

TEACHER: Does anyone have any ideas about which elements of the novel pinpoint it as part of the Romantic movement? Any one? George?
---m43.jpg
TEACHER: George? 
GEORGE: Yeah?
TEACHER: I was asking what conclusion you came to in the exercise we're doing.
---m44.jpg
GEORGE: Sorry. About what, again?
TEACHER: About which elements of the novel pinpoint it as part of the Romantic movement?
---m45.jpg
GEORGE: Which novel?
TEACHER: The Mayor of Casterbrige, George, which, obviously, you didn't read.
---m46.jph
GEORGE: I loved it.
TEACHER: Clearly. Anyone else?
GEORGE: My favorite part of the book is how the town's layout is described from the perspective of a bee traveling from one side of town to the other. It's so visual. So, I guess what Hardy's doing is aligning his point of view not with an all-seeing God but with an insect, the tiniest, humblest creature in nature. Which is pretty Romantic.
---m47.jpg
TEACHER: I think you just found your term paper, George.

SALLY: George. Come join us.
---m48a.jpg
GEORGE: Cool.
SALLY: You know Will and Zoe, right?
GEORGE: Yeah, we're in math class together, right?
---m49.jpg
WILL: You never have your homework.
GEORGE: Right. Right, it's my shtick.
---m50.jpg
ZOE: Hi, George.
GEORGE: Hey, Zoe.
---m51.jpg
WILL: Dude, whatare you always drawing? He's like the mad artist, just hunched over his books. He never listens to a word the teacher says.
SALLY: What, like you do?
WILL: Can I see some of the stuff you draw?
GEORGE: Yeah, sure.
---m52.jpg
SALLY: You have issues.
WILL: No. Dude, you're sensitive. The sensitive artiste. Could you draw something like this for one of my parties? I'm throwing a huge one at my brother's club on New Year's Eve.
GEORGE: You serious?
WILL: You know, we can blow it up, make it a poster, invites, flyers.
SALLY: Yeah, that'd be great, right?

#George and Sally cut school
GEORGE: Rule number one of cutting school.
SALLY: I've cut school before.
GEORGE: To shop. Rule number one, cutting school is fun.
SALLY: That's a rule?
GEORGE: Rule number two, cut rarely to preserve the specialness.
SALLY: Is that even a word?
GEORGE: Rule number three, do something culturally rewarding with your time to earn it morally.
---m55.jpg
SALLY: Rule number four, you're a dork.
---m56.jpg
GEORGE: Wrong. Rule number four, noodles.

SALLY: Is that how you see us? You're the old man and I'm your 12-year-old niece?
GEORGE: No.
SALLY: So you take all the girls to this movie? is it your secret weapon?
GEORGE: When you're cutting school, you go to whatever's playing. 
SALLY: I'm kidding.
===
---m63.jpg
GEORGE: Whoa.
SALLY: What?
GEORGE: That's my stepfather.
SALLY: So?
---m64.jpg
GEORGE: Well, A, his office is on the other side of town. And B, he looks weird.
SALLY: Let's follow him.
---m65.jpg
SALLY: What do you think he's doing?
GEORGE: Probably just going to a meeting.
SALLY: I bet it's a lovers' rendezvous. My stepfather cheated all the time.
GEORGE: Maybe.
SALLY: No offense, but he looks kind of creepy.
---m66.jpg
GEORGE: Strange place for a meeting.
SALLY: Lovers's rendezvous amended to drug buy from skanky hooker.

#George realizes his stepfather has lost his job.

---m69.jpg
GEORGE: Hey, Bill.
PRINCIPAL: You are like a Cold War spy. You move only in shadow.
GEORGE: Me? I'm always around.
PRINCIPAL: I see you made some new friends. I'm happy for you, George. It's just... I want you to be careful.
GEORGE: What's wrong with them.
PRINCIPAL: Nothing. But they have an easier time of getting by than you do. You're not exactly hooking up with a study group. 
---m70.jpg
PRINCIPAL: Hey, I have something for you. Career Day is coming up in a few weeks, and we always assign an exemplary student to represent Morgan to the alumni speakers. You know, to act as a liaison, escort them to the classroom, whatever...
GEORGE: You have really lost it.
PRINCIPAL: Then there is that matter that Mrs. Dougherty broached to me.
GEORGE: The substitue?
PRINCIPAL: Yeah. Smoking on campus is automatic suspension.
---m71.jpg
GEORGE: This is the last thing I wanna do.
PRINCIPAL: No problem. Suspension it is.
GEORGE: Fine. I'll do it.
PRINCIPAL: Great. Great. We'll be sending out an e-mail with your schedule and your responsibilities.

GEORGE: Are you Dustine?
DUSTINE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Hi. I'm George. I'm your liaison.
---m75.jpg
DUSTINE: Hey.
---m76.jpg
DUSTINE: My name is Dustine Heath. I'm a student. I was a student here. I was in the class with that terrifying old man over there.
---m77.jpg
---m78.jpg
DUSTINE: Yeah, I'm an artist. Honestly, I don't know what I am doing here. Was a little hungover when they called me and asked me to do this and I said yes just to get them off the phone. I got the schedule in the mail several days later and I was a little embarrassed. I'm not really established or anything.
---m79.jpg
DUSTINE: I had my first art show a year ago, which was good. Got me this coat.
---m80.jpg
DUSTINE: Well, let me show you some of my work here. I don't know, sometimes people look at your stuff and, you know, they think it's really interesting or they think it's bullshit, and I don't know the difference. I honestly don't. You just, you know, hope not to be fooling yourself, I guess.
---m81.jpg
DUSTINE: This is the next slide, here. Anybody have any questions?
---m82.jpg
---m83.jpg
DUSTINE: I mean, nobody asked me any questions. Did I just suck?
GEORGE: You were probably the only real, non-full-of-it person speaking today.
DUSTINE: It felt like Nagasaki in there.
GEORGE: You were great.
---m84.jpg
DUSTINE: Thanks, man. Do you paint?
GEORGE: Yeah, I'd like to. I just don't know what to paint.
DUSTINE: Yeah, well, it's the hardest part, you know?
---m85.jpg
GEORGE: Does that makes me not a painter?
---m86.jpg
DUSTINE: The fact that you struggle with it is a really good thing. But how can you call yourself a painter if you don't paint? You like Morgan?
GEORGE: Not really. I have no idea what I'm doing here.
DUSTINE: I don't think anybody does, George. At least you admit it. If you want, you can come to my studio in Brooklyn and check some stuff out.
