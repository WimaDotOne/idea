#The year is 1987
JAMES: Hey, you want to get out here?
GIRL: What a rager, huh?
JAMES: Yeah. Yeah. Isn't it weird that all this, this all happened at the end of the semester? You and me.
---m2.jpg
GIRL: James... I don't think I can see you anymore.
JAMES: You don't... What do you mean?
GIRL: Sorry.

ERIC: Women are mercurial, man.

FRIEND: And you did just start dating last week.
JAMES: It was 11 days ago.
ERIC: You didn't tell her about the Scarlet V, did you?
JAMES: That has nothing to do with it.
ERIC: Oh, Christ. Brennan.
JAMES: What?
ERIC: You did! You promised me!
JAMES: I don't lie to people who I care about.
ERIC: Yes, but you could've just left it out of the narrative. You know? You don't want "virgin" to be your signifier.

JAMES: He takes one semiotics class, and I'm supposed to...
FRIEND: Here, drink up.
---m7.jpg
ERIC: Well, you know what, we'll find you a girl, all right? When we're on the Continent.

FRIEND: Here's to sexually-permissive cultures!
ERIC: Yes! Focus on Europe. It's going to be a transformative experience.

#At graduation party.
ALL: To the graduates.

#James' father drinks an old-fashioned.
JAMES: Yeah, so I researched some more youth hostels, and the median cost is jut a little higher than I expected, about $7.68 more, multiplied by the 42 days is $322.56.

MOM: Bill, do you want to take this?
DAD: Execuse me, can you get me a refill here? That's an old-fashioned.
---m12.jpg
JAMES: So with the $368 I have from Grandpa's trust fund, plus the $900 you guys are already giving me, thank you, I do need an additional $279.11.
---m13.jpg
MOM: James, we didn't want to spoil your graduation, but your father has been transferred to a different department.
JAMES: Really? Is that... Is that bad?
---m14.jpg
MOM: Yes, we're making less, considerably less.
JAMES: 'Cause this trip was my graduation present, so...
MOM: Sweetie, I am so sorry about this trip, but I'm afraid we just can't afford it.
---m15.jpg
JAMES: You could still help me with rent next year, right?
MOM: All right, James, you're not listening to me.
---m16.jpg
WAITRESS: Here you go, sir.
DAD: There we go. Thank you very much.
DAD: (Clears throat) Listen, here's to you, kiddo. Happy graduation.
---m17.jpg
JAMES: Wait. What am I going to do about grad school? You know, Columbia's holding a spot for me.
MOM: Well, if you end up deciding that's what you want to do, then obviously you're going to have to get a job.
JAMES: A summer job?

ERIC: Summer in Pittsburgh. That's harsh.
JAMES: It's a nightmare. They don't like people like me where I'm from. You know, we're romantics. I read poetry for pleasure, sometimes.
ERIC: Hey, yeah, well, you know what, don't worry about it, all right?
---m19.jpg
ERIC: You know, with my dad's connections, we'll get a great deal on an apartment. And, hey, I'll float you for the first few months.
JAMES: Yeah?
ERIC: Yeah.
JAMES: Thank you so much, Eric.
ERIC: Hey, don't worry about it.

#Eric ready to light up weed.
ERIC: What the hell are you doing? Our parents are right over...
JAMES: What, them? They're clueless
---m21.jpg 
---m22.jpg
ERIC: This is good weed. Speaking of which, I just want you to know that you'll be with me in spirit this summer.
JAMES: Put that away. No.
ERIC: Take it.
JAMES: No.
ERIC: Take it
JAMES: No. Okay.
ERIC: Look, James, I know things suck right now, all right? But look at it this way, in a few short months, you'll be with me, in New York City, the greatest city in the world!
---m23.jpg
ERIC: Like we always talked about, man. Living the adventure together. Quit worrying, Brennan. That's what the weed is for.
