#One week after Harlan Trombey's demise. At Marta's home.

#Marta wakes up by a nightmare.
---m13.jpg
#Marta's sister Alice stands by the kitchen counter watching a crime drama on her laptop with speaker on.
MOM: Alice, turn that off now, please?
ALICE: Why? It's almost over.
MOM: Now. Please, just turn it off.
ALICE: They're finding out who did it and the Wi-Fi sucks in my room.
MOM: Turn it off, now. Alice!
ALICE: There's two minutes left. There isn't even anything bad on. It's just normal TV.
MOM: Off! They're talking about murder on it! 
---m14.jpg
MOM: Your sister just had a friend she loved slit his throat open and she doesn't need to be hearing that right now! Let's be sensitive.
---m15.jpg
MARTA: Alice, you can keep watching your show. It's fine.
ALICE: No, I guessed who did it anyway.
MARTA: It's okay.
ALICE: I'm sorry, Marta.
MARTA: It's okay.
---m16.jpg
#Marta's phone buzzes.
MARTA: It's Harlan's son.
---m17.jpg
MARTA: Hi, Walt.
WALT: Hi, Marta, it's Walt.
MARTA: Hm-hmm. 
WALT: Would you mind coming to the house early? The police have a few more questions for everybody.
MARTA: What?

---m22.jpg
POLICE: Hey. Excuse me, ma'am. You with the help?
---m23.jpg
MEG: Hey! Her name is Marta. She was Grandad's nurse. She's with us. 
---m24.jpg
MEG: "The help"?
---m25.jpg
MARTA: It's okay. I'm sorry.
MEG: No, it's not okay. What the hell?
---m26.jpg
MEG: How are you doing?
MARTA: Not very good. Alone. Lots of tears and not knowing what to do next.
MEG: Marta, anything you need... You're part of this family.
MARTA: Thank you.
---m27.jpg
LINDA: How you doing, kiddo?
MARTA: Linda.
---m28.jpg
MARTA: How are you?
LINDA: You know, the funeral helped, I guess. Just seeing him. I thought you should have been there. I was outvoted.
---m29.jpg
#Richard gets off the phone.
RICHARD: He's not coming. Ransom. Little brat. Missed the funeral. 
---m30.jpg
WAGNER: We're ready for you now. We'd like to see you one at a time.
LINDA: All right. I'll go first. I'm assuming this will all be wrapped up before the memorial tonight.
---m31.jpg
#Richard pays more attention to his phone than Marta.
RICHARD: So, how you doing, kiddo?

---m32.jpg
ELLIOTT: We're just gonna reintroduce ourselves as a formality. I'm Detective Lieutenant Elliott, and this is Trooper Wagner. 
---m33.jpg
ELLIOTT: Now, I'm going to record this, just to make things easier. All right, we're with Linda Drysdale nee Thrombey. Harlan Thrombey's eldest daughter, and discussing the events that took place the night of his demise one week ago. November 8th.
---m34.jpg
WAGNER: We're very sorry for you loss.
LINDA: Thank you. That means a lot.
ELLIOTT: So, we understand on that nigt the family had gathered to celebrate your father's 85th birthday?
---m35.jpg
LINDA: Yes.
ELLIOTT: How was it?
LINDA: The party? Pre-my-dad's-death? Oh, it was great.
ELLIOTT: Did anyone besides the family show face?
---m36.jpg
LINDA: Fran, the housekeeper. 
---m37.jpg
LINDA: Marta, Harlan's caregiver. Good girl. Hard worker. Her family's from Ecuador.
---m38.jpg
LINDA: And Wanetta. Greatnana. Harlan's mom.
ELLIOTT: Wow. How old is she?
LINDA: We have no idea.
---m39.jpg
#Wanetta didn't show any response even when Meg calls her by her ears.
MEG: Hi nana. hi, nana?
---m40.jpg
ELLIOTT: Okay... and your son, Ransom, did he attend as well?
LINDA: Yes, but he left early.
---m41.jpg
#Wanetta may have seen Ransom leave
WANETTA: Ransom, are you leaving?
---m42.jpg
#Benoit presses a key of the piano. A high note echoes in the big room.
---m43.jpg
ELLIOTT: Right. Would you say that all three of you showed up around the same time?
LINDA: No. Richard came early to help the caterers set up.
ELLIOTT: Okay. And you and your husband, Richard, work at a real estate firm in Boston?
LINDA: No. It's... It's my company.
ELLIOTT: Rigth. Right. Sorry.
LINDA: I built my business from the ground up.
---m44.jpg
#Linda tears up when he recalls his dad.
ELLIOTT: Oh, just like your father. You two are very close.
LINDA: We have our own secret way of communicating. I mean, you had to find that with Dad. You had to find a game to play with him, and if you did that, and you played by the rules...
===
---m45.jpg
RICHARD: Everyone idolizes their dad, right?
ELLIOTT: I don't know. Do they?
RICHARD: Very much not. Don't know why I said that.
---m46.jpg
RICHARD: But my wife Linda does. Harlan started out with a rusty Smith Corona and built himself into one of the best-selling mystery writers of all time.
---m47.jpg
ELLIOTT: Wow, seems like all his kids are self-made overachievers.
RICHARD: Sure.
===
---m48.jpg
ELLIOTT: For the record, I'm speaking with Walt Thrombey, Harlan Thrombey's youngest son. So you run your father's publishing company?
WALT: Yeah. It's my... It's our... It's the family's publishing company. Dad trusts me to run it. 30 languages. Over 80 million copies sold. A real legacy. You guys fans?
---m49.jpg
ELLIOTT: I mean, I don't do much fiction reading myself, but...
WAGNER: Big fan. I'm a big fan. I mean, his plots are just like... Like, I won't spoil it for you but... Okay, like Thousand Knives? The cow and the shotgun. Like, where do you come up with that?
---m50.jpg
#Just after Walt mentions the word "plots", Benoit presses the key of the piano once more.
WALT: Well, Dad said the plots just popped into his head, fully formed. It was the easy part for him.
ELLIOTT: So you're in the area, right? So, you guys probably arrived around the same time.
WALT: We got here around 8:00.
---m51.jpg
WALT: My wife, Donna, she's my rock.
---m52.jpg
WALT: My son, Jacob, he's 16. Very politically active.
---m53.jpg
RICHARD: The boy is literally a Nazi.
---m54.jpg
MEG: He's an alt-right troll dipshit.
---m55.jpg
WALT: Kids today with the Internet, it's amazing.
ELLIOTT: So the night went well?
---m56.jpg
WALT: I mean, we're all gutted, but... I was happy to have that night with him. To be by his side, to think about our books and what we've accomplished with them. It's like I can still feel his hand on my shoulder. Passing the torch.
===
---m57.jpg
ELLIOTT: So we're here with Joni Thrombey, Harlan Thrombey's daughter-in-law?
JONI: Yeah, I married his son, Neil. We had one daughter, Meg. And then Neil passed on 15 years ago.
ELLIOTT: But you remained close to the Thrombeys.
---m58.jpg
JONI: They're my family. I feel simultaneously freed by and supported by them. It's that balance of opposites that's the nugget of Flam.
---m59.jpg
ELLIOTT: Sorry, the nugget of...
JONI: Flam
ELLIOTT: Oh, yeah, Flam, your skin care company. Sorry.
JONI: I forgive you. Yeah, it's skin care, but it promotes a total lifestyle. Self-sufficiency with an acknowlegement of human need. That's Flam. But it's also Harlan. He got me and Meg through some tough times.
---m60.jpg
MEG: Granddad gives my mom a yearly allowance and he's never missed wiring a tuition payment to my schools. He's a genuinely selfless 
ELLIOTT: But you left the party early.
MEG: To see some friends at Smith.
---m61.jpg
JONI: I think Linda was upset that Meg left the party early. But Harlan understood. (Benoit presses a key one more time) If I could pause? Who is that guy? And why are we doing all this again?
===
---m62.jpg
ELLIOTT: These all just some follow-up question. We're attempting to be thorough, so we can figure out the manner of death.
WALT: So by "manner of death," you mean if someone killed him? If one of us killed him? One of his family killed him? Is that what you're suggesting, Lieutenant?
ELLIOTT: No, Walt... Walt, no, no. No one's saying that, okay? This is all pro forma.
RICHARD: Okay. So who is that?
ELLIOTT: This is Benoit Blanc. Mr. Blanc is a private investigator of great renown. Mr. Blanc is not with the police department and not officially involved in the case, but he's offered to consult.
---m63.jpg
LINDA: Mr. Blanc, I know who you are. I read your profile in the New Yorker. I found it delightful. I just buried my 85-year-old father who committed suicide. Why are you here?
BENOIT: I'm here at the behest of a client.
LINDA: Who?
---m64.jpg
BENOIT: I cannot say. But let me assure you of this. My presence will be ornamental. You will find me a respectful, quiet, passive observer... of the truth.
---m65.jpg
RICHARD: Fine. Are we getting there?
---m66.jpg
BENOIT: Nearly. Um... Harlan's nurse, she was at the party in a professional capacity?
---m67.jpg
RICHARD: Marta? I guess. Harlan hired her to be around to take care of whatever medical needs popped up.
---m68.jpg
RICHARD: But really, she's like part of the family. Good kid. Been a good friend to Harlan. Family's from Paraguay. Linda really likes her work ethic.
---m69.jpg
RICHARD: "Immigrants. We get the job done." From Hamilton.
WAGNER: It's so good. It's so good.
RICHARD: I saw it at The Public.
---m70.jpg
BENOIT: May I just... Then I'll recede, but... as a self-made man myself, I have to express my admiration for how you followed in your father's footsteps.
---m71.jpg
LINDA: Thank you.
BENOIT: Just marvelous. You know, the whole family too. And Joni with her thing, and Walt with his publishing empire...
LINDA: Well. Yes, I mean, Walt, he's done well with what Dad gave him. Not that matters. But really, Dad hands him a book twice a year and Walt publishes it. It's just not the same.
BENOIT: But surely Walt runs the merchandising, adaptations, film and television rights, I mean...
---m71a.jpg
LINDA: Are you baiting me, Detective? You know he doesn't. And if you think I am dumb enough to be baited into talking family business, into trash-talking my baby brother in front of a police detective and a state trooper...
---m72.jpg
RICHARD: Walt doesn't run anything. Because there are no TV and film rights. Harlan never allowed any adaptations of his books. Hated the idea.
BENOIT: No.
RICHARD: Yeah! Drives Walt nuts. 'Cause that's where the real money is. 
---m73.jpg
RICHARD: When Walt would get a little Irish courage in him, he'd get into it with Harlan.
BENOIT: Did he "get into it" at the party?
RICHARD: Oh, my God! Wouldn't leave him alone, the poor guy. Harlan finally had to give him the hook. I didn't hear what he said, but he must've really handed him his lunch. 'Cause Walt was like a wounded puppy the rest of the night.
===
---m74.jpg
WALT: What? Richard said what? No. Jesus. We did not get "into it."
BENOIT: I'm just trying to get an accurate impression. Harlan took you aside at the party. When you returned, you were chastened. What did Harlan say to you?
---m75.jpg
#WALT deep in recall.
---m76.jpg
WALT: The Netflix guys, their business affair guy. He sent something over. It's hard numbers this time. And I just think this is a window that's not gonna stay open. We need to take advantage of it and then you just need to look at the numbers!
HARLAN: Yeah, Walt, look...
WALT: Dad! Dad! You... You put me in charge of our books. Let me be in charge! Let me do this! Please!
HARLAN: They're not our books, son. They are my books. And this is not how I wanted to have this conversation. But you're right, you're right. It's...It's unfair of me to keep you tethered to something that isn't yours to control.
WALT: What?
HARLAN: No, I've done you a grave disservice. All these years, I've kept you from building something of your own that was yours. But you're not going to be running the publishing house anymore. You're free of it.
WALT: Dad, are you firing me?
HARLAN: No. We'll talk details tomorrow. My mind's made up. Goodboy.
---m77.jpg
---m78.jpg
#Walt comes back from deep recall.
WALT: We talked. We had a business discussion about e-books. Jesus. It was nothing. You want to talk about an argument, hell, Ransom had an argument with him.
---m78a.jpg
BENOIT: Ransom, that's... Richard and Linda's son?
WALT: Look, we all love Ransom. He's a good kid. We love him.
---m79.jpg
BENOIT: But?
---m80.jpg
WALT: But he's always been the black sheep of the family. And I'm not trying to... I like to keep stuff like this in the family. But with Ransom, he's never had a job. And Dad, for some unknown reason, always supported him. They have this love-hate bond. They fight. But that night, God, they had a blowout.
BENOIT: About what?
---m81.jpg
#The whole family hear through the wall 
RANSOM: Are you goddamn insane?
---m82.jpg
RICHARD: We couldn't make it out really, but it was huge. And it's strange they went into another room to do it. Usually they like to stoke up drama in front fo the whole family.
---m83.jpg
===
---m84.jpg
JONI: The house?
BENOIT: Earlier. Richard said you were there.
JONI: I was at the house early.
BENOIT: To see Harlan?
JONI: To see Harlan. Yes.
---m85.jpg
BENOIT: What were you seeing Harlan about?
JONI: It was just a mix-up with the... the payment for Meg's tuition.
---m85a.jpg
BENOIT: I'm sorry to press, but what kind of mix-up?
---m86.jpg
#Joni deep in recall.
---m87.jpg
JONI: Yeah, the school hasn't got the check yet. I don't know why Alan didn't mail it.
HARLAN: Well, Alan didn't mail it because he caught a discrepancy.
---m88.jpg
HARLAN: Alan's office has been wiring tuition directly to the school as per your request. But Phyllis's office that handles your yearly allowance has been wiring tuition monies directly to you as well. 
---m89.jpg
HARLAN: You have been double-dipping Meg's tuition and stealing from me... $100,000 a year, for the past four years.
JONI: Harlan, I don't know how this mix-up happened, but I swear to God... 
HARLAN: So I'm writing this tuition check, but you must know that this is the last money you or Meg will get from me.
---m90.jpg
JONI: Please, you don't understand...
HARLAN: Joni, I know it'll hurt, but it's all for the best. My mind's made up.
---m91.jpg
#Joni comes back from deep recall.
JONI: It was a money wiring issue with the office at the school. So I had to ask Harlan to cut a check for the semester. No big deal.
---m92.jpg
ELLIOTT: Why don't we, uh, take a little break and we'll resume... oh, no. She's gone.
---m93.jpg
===
---m94.jpg
---m95.jpg
ELLIOTT: See, I might be a victim of my own expectation here, but when the great Benoit Blanc comes knocking at my door, I expect it's going to be about something, if not extraodinary, then at least interesting.
---m96.jpg
ELLIOTT: But I'm sorry, this is an open-and-shut case of suicide and quite frankly, Benny, we're getting to the point where I need to know what we're doing here.
---m97.jpg
BENOIT: The method? Throat slit? Typical for a suicide?
ELLIOTT: Yes, I mean, that's dramatic. But look around. I mean, the guy practically lives in a Clue board. Come on, 
---m98.jpg
#Marta waits nervously in a room. She can hear people talking outside.
ELLIOT: Benny, talk to me, all right? Now, you tell me to invite all of these people back for questioning all over again. I get it.
---m99.jpg
WAGNER: I've had boots on the ground in this country for a while. People are generally what they seem to be. Not gonna find murderers in this family.
---m100.jpg
---m101.jpg
---m102.jpg
---m103.jpg
---m104.jpg
#Marta tries to eavesdrop on the conversation outside.
---m105.jpg
ELLIOT: This is a pleasant family with the usual quarrels, but no possible motives for murder. Where are you going?
---m106.jpg
#Marta is startled by Benoit.
===
---m107.jpg
BENOIT: Harlan Thrombey's nurse. Marta...
Marta: Cabrera.
BENOIT: Marta Cabrera. Please.
---m108.jpg
BENOIT: Miss Babrera. I've been doing a little poking. You were hired on a part-time basis as a registered nurse, yes?
MARTA: Yes, I don't work for a VNA. Harlan hired me directly.
BENOIT: Take a seat, please. And you're paid a flat rate for... how many hours a week?
---m109.jpg
MARTA: Well I started at 15, and then he... needed more help.
BENOIT: Medical help?
MARTA: He needed a friend.
BENOIT: Does having a kind heart make you a good nurse?
---m110.jpg
BENOIT: Marta? We were just discussing possible motives in the family. I suspect that Harlan has told you much unfiltered truth about each of them. And a little bird has told me... how shall I put this delicately? You have a regurgitative reaction to mistruthing.
---m111.jpg
MARTA: Who told you that?
BENOIT: Is it true?
MARTA: Yes. It's something I've had since I was a kid. It's a physical thing that I... Just the thought of lying... Yeah, it makes me puke.
BENOIT: Really.
---m112.jpg
---m113.jpg
BENOIT: Is Richard having an affair?
---m114.jpg
#Marta in deep recall.
---m115.jpg
HARLAN: Why do men instinctively pull at loose threads on their parachutes?
BENOIT: What?
---m116.jpg
#Harlan shows Marta what he has on his computer.
---m117.jpg
#Marta comes back from recall.
MARTA: Richard? An affair?
BENOIT: A yes or no will do.
MARTA: No.
---m118.jpg
#Marta throws up.
BENOIT: Dear girl, I'm sorry. I assumed you were speaking figuratively.
---m119.jpg
BENOIT: I was obviously right. Richard is having an affair. His father-in-law found out and confronted him. "You tell her or I will."
ELLIOT: Okay, but even if that were the case, protecting a relationship as a motive, that's weak sauce. You know that.
BENOIT: Well, then there is Joni.
---m120.jpg
BENOIT: Miss Cabrera, one moment, please.
MARTA: Yes, I just wanna get some Scope.
BENOIT: Miss Cabrera... Was Harlan planning on cutting off Joni's allowance?
---m121.jpg
MARTA: Oh, my God.
ELLIOT: All right, don't answer that if you're gonna puke again, please.
---m122.jpg
ELLIOT: Allowance as a motive? Again, more weak sauce. You're just dumping that vat of weak sauce on me.
BENOIT: Granted. But she lied to me. All three of them did.
ELLIOT: Three?
BENOIT: Walt. Harlan had turned Walt down before regarding film rights, but that night something Harlan said shook him. Now we look at the pattern. Harlan was cleaning house.
Marta: Can I just wait inside? I feel like I shouldn't be here.
===
---m123.jpg
BENOIT: You have been very patient, my friend. You are right. None of these weak alibis and domestic squibbles answer your question, "Why is Benoit Blanc here?" Well now I will tell you why.
BENOIT: I'm here because this morning, someone dodged a very important question.
ELLIOT: Who?
BENOIT: Me. Linda asked who hired me.
ELLIOT: Well, who hired you?
---m124.jpg
BENOIT: I do not know. An envelope of cash showed up at my apartment yesteray with a news clipping of Thrombey's death.
WAGNER: An envelope? That worked?
BENOIT: An envelope of cash. So somebody suspects foul play and goes through this ha-cha dance of hiring me, of staying anonymous. It makes no damn sense. 
---m125.jpg
Compels me, though. Walk me through everyone's whereabouts at the time of death.
===
---m126.jpg
ELLIOT: We know that the party ended around 11:30. 
---m127.jpg
ELLIOT: Marta took Harlan upstairs to give him his meds.
---m128.jpg
ELLIOT: The stairs leading up to Harlan's bedroom and his attic office creak horribly.
---m129.jpg
ELLIOT: Linda is a light sleeper. So we know every time someone took the stairs that night.
---m130.jpg
ELLIOT: The first was when Joni heard a ka-thunk from somewhere above her in the house.
---m131.jpg
ELLIOT: She's concerned about Harlan, so she goes up to investigate, waking Linda.
---m132.jpg
ELLIOT: Harlan was in his attic office with Marta. He explained that they had knocked over the Go board. That game with the grid and stones. They play it every night.
---m133.jpg
MARTA: Walt, I'm leaving.
---m134.jpg
ELLIOT: Ten minutes later, Linda is awoken a second time by Marta leaving. Walt was smoking a cigar on the porch with his son. He saw her leave and drive off. Noted the time
---m135.jpg
ELLIOT: Midnight.
---m136.jpg
ELLIOT: 15 minutes later, Linda is awoken for the 3rd and final time... by someone coming down the stairs. Harlan, who came down for a midnight snack, which Walt tried to discourage.
---m137.jpg
WALT: Dad, go back to bed.
---m138.jpg
ELLIOT: Based on this, the medical examiner determined the time of death to be between 12:15 and 2:00 a.m. As Walt was finishing his cigar at about 12:30, Meg came home. She was straight to bed. Walt and Jacob turned in shortly after that.
---m139.jpg
ELLIOT: And sometime later that night, it's undetermined, but possibly near 3:00 a.m. Meg woke up because the dogs were barking outside. She used the bathroom, went back to bed.
---m140.jpg
ELLIOT: That's it. All right? Now, everyone's stories matched, every moment accounted for.
===
---m141.jpg
BENOIT: And there is no other staircase up to Harlan's room?
ELLIOT: None, just the creaky one.
BENOIT: Interesting.
---m142.jpg
WAGNER: So, uh, we know that Ransom didn't do it because he wasn't there. Marta couldn't have. Harlan was still alive when she left. Meg came home during the window of the time of death, right?
---m143.jpg
ELLIOT: Except it was a suicide, all right? Harlan slit right through his carotid. We saw from the blood splat patterns that they were uninterrupted, meaning it's almost impossible for anyone to have been around him at the time. He's the one who cut his own throat. I don't know why we keep going over this.
---m144.jpg
BENOIT: Physical evidence can tell a clear story with a forked tongue.
ELLIOT: What?
BENOIT: And as we can see from this morning, everyone can lie. Well, almost everyone.
===
---m145.jpg
BENOIT: Miss Cabrera. We kept you waiting all afternoon, because I wanted to hear from you last. 
---m146.jpg
BENOIT: I needed an entire picture of the evening in my head, and your piece of it is at its very center. 
---m147.jpg
BENOIT: So, please, take your time.
---m148.jpg
BENOIT: You took Mr. Thrombey upstairs at 11:30 and left at midnight. Think very carefully and with as much detail as possible.
---m149.jpg
#Marta in deep recall
BENOIT: Tell us what happened in that half hour?
===
---m150.jpg
#Harlan went up to the attic instead of his bedroom.
HARLAN: Up, up, up, I got it.
MARTA: Okay, that's... Hey, Harlan. Let's...
---m151.jpg
HARLAN: On second thoughts.
MARTA: No. No, no, no, no...
HARLAN: Get up here!
MARTA: I had a glass of champagne. Harlan, listen to me. It's late. I had...
HARLAN: You only had one glass.
MARTA: Exactly. A glass of champagne.
HARLAN: We are not breaking tradition on my birthday!
---m152.jpg
MARTA: Can you just take your goddamn medicine and go to bed?
HARLAN: If you're gonna put that vile stuff in me, you have to earn it. On my birthday.
MARTA: Fine. Jesus! Okay, let's do this. 9 by 9. You ready? Are you sure?
HARLAN: I'll whip your ass.
MARTA: How dare you.
---m153.jpg
MARTA: I know how this's gonna end. What is that?
HARLAN: Why can't I beat you at this game?
MARTA: Because I'm not playing to beat you. I'm playing to build a beautiful pattern.
HARLAN: That's elder abuse. I'm gonna call the AARP.
MARTA: Don't make me get the belt, abuelo.
HARLAN: It's basically over. My only hope is that an earth quake will strike.
---m154.jpg
#Harlan shakes the table.
HARLAN: But what are the chances? Hello? Hello? Get under a door frame!
---m155.jpg
---m156.jpg
---m157.jpg
#Medicines fall to the floor.
===
---m158.jpg
MARTA: Such a bad loser you are! Meds, then bed. I'm done with you.
HARLAN: That's fair.
---m160.jpg
#Marta picks up the medicines and prepares for the injection.
---m161.jpg
#Marta injects medicine into Harlan's forearm.
HARLAN: Walt is smoking that filthy cigar out there on the porch. Dead and nasty things.
MARTA: How was tonight.
HARLAN: Tonight was... good.
MARTA: Oh, yeah? I know you weren't looking forward to it.
HARLAN: No, but I did it. I cut the line on all four of them. Yeah. Wasn't easy. This goddamn fortune.
---m162.jpg
HARLAN: You know, sometimes I think that everything I've given my family, I've done maybe without knowing, or maybe to keep them beneath me. 
---m163.jpg
HARLAN: I certainly should have... I don't know, encouraged Walt to write his own stories, not just be a caretaker of mine. Like you said I should. 
---m164.jpg
HARLAN: And then be a father and not just a provider for Joni, like you also said. And I could have been kinder to Linda and Ransom. Jesus! Ransom. There's so much of me in that kid. Confident. Stupid. I don't know, protected. Playing life like a game, without consequence. 
---m165.jpg
HARLAN: Until you can't tell the difference between a stage prop and a real knife.

HARLAN: You know I don't fear death. But, oh God. I'd like to fix some of this before I go. Close the book with a flourish. I guess we'll see.

MARTA: I guess we will. Hey. You had a long day.

MARTA: You wanna do drugs?
HARLAN: You mean the good stuff? 
MARTA: Yeah?
HARLAN: Oh, come on, send me to la-la land.
MARTA: Just a tiny bit, okay?

HARLAN: Why did I wait till my mid-age to become a morphine user? What a schmuck. What a nudnik. This stuff is the best.

MARTA: Oh, my God.

HARLAN: Is there a problem?
MARTA: This is what I just gave you 100 milligrams of. I messed up.
HARLAN: You gave me 100 milligrams of the good stuff? Excuse me, but what is the good stuff's dosage supposed to be?
---m176.jpg
MARTA: Let's not call it that right now, okay? 3 milligrams.
HARLAN: Oh, that's much less. So what happens?
---m177.jpg
MARTA: I'm gonna give you an emergency shot of Naloxone, so you don't die in ten minutes.
---m178.jpg
HARLAN: Oh, well, no pressure. You know, this is an interesting and efficient method of murder. I need to write this down. So, if someone switched the meds on purpose, I'd be dead in ten minutes. Like stone-cold dead?
MARTA: Yes. You'll feel symptoms in five. Sweats, disorientation, and then... Yes. That big dose injected, within ten, your... Your brain...
---m179.jpg
MARTA: Yes, ten minutes.
HARLAN: From the moment of injection? It's eight-ish now. 
---m180.jpg
HARLAN: And even if the victim called for an ambulance when you first felt the symptoms and if he lived in a great big country house like we do, the ambulance would take at least 15 minutes to arrive and then it'd be too late.

HARLAN: If the victim didn't have the emergency Naxostuff. Marta? Do you have the Naxostuff?
---m183.jpg
MARTA: Yes, I'm gonna find it. 
---m184.jpg
MARTA: I have it because it comes with the kit, so it should be here. It has to be. It's like... 
---m185.jpg
MARTA: It's not here, Harlan. I don't know why it's not here. 
---m186.jpg
---m187.jpg
MARTA: So, I'm gonna use the phone, okay? To call an ambulance.

#Harlan cuts off the phone.

MARTA: What are you doing?
