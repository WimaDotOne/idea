#In the morning one day before high school graduation. Molly is medidating while listening to a tape. A women's voice comes out of the speaker. There's tranquil music playing in the background. 
Good morning, winner. Take a deep breath. Good. you're ready to dominate this day.

#Her shelf is full of photos of female role models.
You've worked harder than everyone and that is why you're a champion.

You understand that greatness takes sacrifice. Visualize what you still want to achieve.

Stand atop the mountain of your success and look down at everyone who's ever doubted you.

Fuck those losers. Fuck them in their stupid fucking faces.

#Molly and Amy dance in silly moves
MOLLY: Missed you.
AMY: I missed you. I missed you so much.
MOLLY: Been one night.

MOLLY: No. I don't think we are.
AMY: No, we're just gonna stay here.

MOLLY: Principal Brown?

#Principal Brown groans realizing Molly is visiting. He forces a happy face.
PRINCIPAL: Hi, Molly, Amy. What's skaking?
MOLLY: I want to make the transition of next year's student government as seamless as possible, so that when I'm up in New Haven...

PRINCIPAL: Yale. You can just say Yale, please.
---m19.jpg
#Molly tries to put on a poker face, not showing that she feels pleased at the sound of "Yale"
AMY: Well, our class' official policy is to not discuss where anyone is attending next year. We don't want them to feel insecure.
PRINCIPAL: Very thoughtful.

MOLLY: Anyway, I need to go over the end-of-the-year budget numbers we have.
PRINCIPAL: Oh, gosh. Really? Like, now? What... I mean, why don't you do it with Nick, you know? Please? I mean, he's you know, he's the vice president.
---m21.jpg
MOLLY: Nick? We both know that Nick only ran for VP because they plan the dances. That position is... It's basically a popularity contest. He's useless.
PRINCIPAL: Ladies, it's the last day. You know? We did it. Huh? We got you through high school.
---m22.jpg
PRINCIPAL: Can't we just graduate, head off to college, you know, celebrate this wonderful achievement? Let's focus on getting through the rest of the day without...

MOLLY: I'm sorry. Are you shutting the door on us? Because that's not subtle. We will persist!
